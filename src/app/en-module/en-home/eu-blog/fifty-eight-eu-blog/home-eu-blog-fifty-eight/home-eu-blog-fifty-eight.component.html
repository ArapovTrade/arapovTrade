                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello, friends! My name is Igor Arapov, and today we’re going to talk about <strong
                            class="orange">averaging</strong> in trading—how
                        to do it correctly, the risks involved, and how to manage those risks.</p>

                    <p><strong class="orange">Averaging</strong> is a straightforward concept. Imagine you bought one
                        Bitcoin at $10,000.
                        Then the price drops to $5,000. This often happens to beginners who buy at the peak. Now you’re
                        facing a $5,000
                        loss. You might think, "If I buy another Bitcoin at $5,000, my average purchase price drops to
                        $7,500." That way,
                        you need a smaller price increase to break even.</p>

                    <p>It sounds logical, but in practice, <strong class="orange">averaging</strong> against the trend
                        often leads to bigger
                        losses. Why is that?</p>

                    <p>First, if you’re trading without risk control, you’re already in a dangerous position. Trading
                        without a
                        stop-loss—and <strong class="orange">averaging</strong> is essentially trading without a
                        stop-loss—is a risky
                        strategy. Even when <strong class="orange">averaging</strong>, you need to have a stop-loss in
                        place. When you
                        average down against the trend, you’re buying into a weakening market. If the market continues
                        to drop, you could
                        face even greater losses.</p>

                    <p>Markets can change quickly. For example, shifts in monetary policy can cause a currency to
                        devalue rapidly. Take the
                        euro/dollar, which dropped from 1.4 to parity in just 13 weeks. In such cases, <strong
                            class="orange">averaging</strong> won’t save you. Trends can last much longer than traders
                        expect, and if you
                        plan to <strong class="orange">average</strong>, you would need to start with very small
                        positions to avoid running
                        out of funds—an approach that’s not very efficient.</p>

                    <p>That’s why <strong class="orange">averaging</strong> against the trend is generally a bad idea.
                        It’s a high-risk move
                        that can wipe out your account. As a standalone trading strategy, <strong
                            class="orange">averaging</strong> should
                        not be used. The only time <strong class="orange">averaging</strong> makes sense is when you’re
                        following the trend,
                        and even then, it should be done with a stop-loss in place. Trading with the trend gives you a
                        positive mathematical
                        expectation, and <strong class="orange">averaging</strong> can enhance your returns in such
                        cases. It’s a tool for
                        increasing profits, but if you trade against the trend, your account will quickly diminish. If
                        you trade with the
                        trend, your account can grow quickly. However, managing your risks is crucial.</p>

                    <p>These are the key principles for working with <strong class="orange">averaging</strong> and the
                        most important risks
                        to be aware of. I recommend that beginners avoid using this strategy. <strong
                            class="orange">Averaging</strong> is
                        best left to experienced traders and should only be done in line with the trend. Beginners
                        should focus on trading
                        with clear stop-losses and managing risks carefully. It’s important to first learn how to
                        understand the market and
                        improve your ability to make accurate predictions. Since trading is all about probabilities, you
                        need to be aware
                        that increasing your risk—<strong class="orange">averaging</strong> is one way to do that—can be
                        very costly.</p>
