                    </h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov and today we will discuss the main technical patterns, or
                        price patterns, in
                        technical analysis. This topic is very popular and is the foundation of technical analysis, as
                        traders look for
                        formations that have worked in the past. For example, the "head and shoulders" pattern often
                        predicts a trend
                        reversal, and traders tend to sell when they see it.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Why are technical patterns used?</h3>
                    <p>Personally, I do not use technical patterns because they work with the same probability as they
                        do not work. It's
                        just statistics, and in the long run, they do not provide an advantage. But why are they used
                        then? Perhaps because
                        the brain tries to find patterns in chaos. Just as a person distinguishes a tiger in the forest,
                        traders distinguish
                        patterns in the market.</p>

                    <p>The market is chaotic, and participants make decisions about buying or selling. However, there
                        are also smart
                        participants, and we analyze their trades through volumes. Today we are talking about patterns.
                        If we see price
                        fluctuations and patterns on the chart, it helps structure the chaos and make decisions. For
                        example, a double top
                        shows that buyers cannot push the price higher, and a bearish trend begins to form.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Limitations of patterns</h3>
                    <p>However, patterns do not always work. A Nobel laureate proved that "head and shoulders" is just a
                        picture that does
                        not always reverse the market. But traders see it and tend to sell, expecting a reversal. What
                        is important is not
                        the pictures themselves, but how market participants react to them.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Market sentiment analysis and volume analysis</h3>
                    <p>Market sentiment analysis and volume analysis are much more important because they show what
                        market participants are
                        doing. If they are buying, the price goes up, if they are selling, it goes down. Patterns do not
                        predict the market,
                        they show possible scenarios for its development.</p>

                    <p>Patterns program us for certain actions. If you see a flag, you expect growth and buy. But this
                        is not a market
                        forecast, just a possible scenario. In practice, I have not found useful applications for
                        technical analysis
                        patterns. But it is worth knowing them because they influence the actions of other market
                        participants.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Using patterns in the Smart Money concept</h3>
                    <p>In the Smart Money concept, these patterns are used to capture liquidity. Large players
                        manipulate the market,
                        creating movements that catch participants' orders. This helps them take advantageous positions,
                        but no more than
                        that.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Advice for beginner traders</h3>
                    <p>My advice to beginner traders: do not focus on patterns, they will not benefit you. Look at more
                        subtle things: not
                        at the pictures themselves, but at what is behind them and what they can lead to.</p>
