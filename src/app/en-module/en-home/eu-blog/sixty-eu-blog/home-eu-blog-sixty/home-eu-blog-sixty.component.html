                    </h1>


                    <p>Hello, friends! My name is Igor Arapov, and today, by popular request from my subscribers, I’ll
                        talk about <strong class="orange">binary options</strong> and trading. I should note that in my
                        11 years of trading, I’ve never
                        traded <strong class="orange">binary options</strong>. When I was starting out, I was told that
                        in most cases, they
                        don’t work out, so I decided not to waste time on them. Therefore, my response will be a logical
                        analysis based on
                        what I found using the G Mini neural network (just Google) by searching "binary options."</p>

                    <p>So, <strong class="orange">binary options</strong> are a financial instrument that allows traders
                        to bet on whether
                        the price of an asset will rise or fall within a certain period of time. It’s similar to
                        trading, but with the added
                        condition of time.</p>

                    <p>Trading is challenging on its own, and here you need not only to predict the market but also to
                        do it within a
                        specific time frame, which complicates things. For example, in regular trading, you can buy the
                        euro-dollar pair and
                        set a stop-loss, expecting the price to move in your favor. This is straightforward and
                        relatively simple. But if
                        you need the euro to rise on a specific day or week, it becomes more difficult.</p>

                    <p>Next, I found information that you need to choose an asset, direction, and expiration time for
                        the option—ranging
                        from a few minutes to a few days. Personally, as a trader, this feels uncomfortable to me. It
                        adds another layer of
                        complexity to forecasting.</p>

                    <p>The outcome is this: if your prediction is correct, you get a fixed profit. But the problem is
                        that you earn less
                        than what you risk. In trading, we control risk using stop-losses and aim to earn more than we
                        risk. But with
                        <strong class="orange">binary options</strong>, you’re risking more than you can potentially
                        earn. I don’t like
                        that.
                    </p>

                    <p>And if you look at the statistics on <strong class="orange">binary options</strong> traders, I
                        think it becomes clear
                        why the conditions are unfavorable. Overall, the terms of trading <strong class="orange">binary
                            options</strong>
                        seem to work against us and in favor of the exchange.</p>
