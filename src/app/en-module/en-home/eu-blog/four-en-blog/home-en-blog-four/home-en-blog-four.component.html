                    <p>Hello, friends! I'm Igor Arapov, and I have been trading for over 11 years. Today, I want to
                        share my experience with
                        beginners and discuss the main reasons why traders lose their deposits. These are the key
                        mistakes that lead to a
                        complete loss of money.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">First and foremost</h3>
                    <p>Deposit loss occurs due to a lack of understanding of the profession. If a trader does not
                        understand what they are
                        doing in the market, they are doomed to lose money. This manifests in several ways: firstly,
                        they do not control
                        risks. Without risk control, your deposit will be lost – it is only a matter of time, because
                        most traders trade
                        with leverage. We are not talking about investing, where you buy something and forget about it,
                        but about leveraged
                        trading, where margin creates conditions in which, if the price goes against you by a sufficient
                        number of points,
                        you will simply be stopped out and lose everything.</p>

                    <p>Lack of risk control is the first and main reason for account loss. Many beginners do not
                        understand where to place a
                        stop-loss. They see the price moving up and down and think: why place a stop-loss when you can
                        just hold the trade
                        in the market? You need to wait, and the price will go in the desired direction, and I will
                        break even or make a
                        profit.</p>

                    <p>This approach is dangerous. There are phases when the market moves sideways, and within this
                        range, you can wait out
                        any market movement. But remember the traders who tried to short Bitcoin throughout its entire
                        rise. The CME
                        exchange showed how many millions and billions were lost by short-traders, that is, those who
                        tried to sell Bitcoin
                        futures. A future works in such a way that you take Bitcoin as collateral and are obliged to
                        return it regardless of
                        the price difference. If you sell Bitcoin and it rises, you will have to buy it back at higher
                        prices, fixing a
                        loss.</p>

                    <p>On this entire trend, a huge amount of money was lost. The market simply soared without a chance
                        of a return, and
                        those who sold either lost their deposits or are on the verge of it. The percentage change in
                        the asset was so
                        significant that no proper deposit management could have saved it.</p>

                    <p>If you approach trading this way, profitability will tend to zero, and it simply does not make
                        sense. The history of
                        Bitcoin showed that without risk control, you are doomed to lose your account – this is the
                        first main problem.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">The second problem</h3>
                    <p>Is risk overestimation. Even if you place stops, you still try to earn much more than
                        realistically possible, and you
                        overestimate the lot size, for example, up to 5, 10, 15% of the account. You think that
                        everything will go now, and
                        you will make a lot of money. But in the long run, this leads to failure because there are no
                        strategies that with a
                        99% probability always provide profitable entry points. A normal strategy gives 70 to 30: out of
                        100 trades, 30 will
                        be losing. It can be a big loss or a small one, it all depends on the setting of your trading
                        system. But with a
                        probability of 70 to 30, in thirty cases, you will be at a loss. If you remember about
                        dispersion in mathematics, it
                        turns out that 30 losing trades can fall in a row 5, 6, 7, 8, even 10 times. The chance will
                        decrease, but it is
                        real. Ten times you get a loss in a row, and dispersion simply eats your deposit.</p>

                    <p>Everything else is not so critical and not so dangerous for the deposit as for both beginners and
                        experienced
                        traders. The trader themselves is usually the cause of the deposit loss, not the market. The
                        market lives its life.
                        Fighting the market is the problem. The trader who sells the trend is the problem, not the
                        market.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">To summarize</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>First – lack of risk control. Without stops, you are doomed.</li>
                        <li>Second – overestimated lot, that is, overestimated trade volume.</li>
                        <li>Third – arguing with the market.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>If you eliminate these three main problems from your trading, most likely, everything will be
                        fine with you. In my 11
                        years, I have seen that these were always the key factors. No matter how many traders I have
                        communicated with, no
                        matter how many bitter mistakes I made at the beginning, these three problems were always at the
                        core. If you get
                        rid of them, you can safely trade, develop your account, and everything will be fine with you.
                        But if you start
                        making these mistakes, be prepared for problems – they will not keep you waiting long.</p>
