                                Level trading is one of the most effective approaches in technical analysis. It enables
                                traders to identify
                                key zones where the price may change direction or continue its movement. In this
                                article, we will
                                thoroughly examine what levels are, how to establish them, and which strategies to use
                                for trading.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What Is a Level in Trading?</h2>
                            <p>
                                A level is a horizontal line on a chart that represents a range where the price has
                                previously changed
                                direction. Levels are categorized into two types: support and resistance.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Types of Levels</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Support Level:</strong> A zone where the price stops falling and starts to
                                    rise.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resistance Level:</strong> A zone where the price halts its upward movement
                                    and begins to
                                    decline.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="flex">

                            </div>
                            <h3>How to Identify a Level?</h3>
                            <p>
                                To establish a level, find points on the chart where the price has sharply changed
                                direction. The sharper
                                the reversal, the more significant the level. Consider the following factors:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Impulsive price movement.</li>
                                <li>High trading volumes at the level.</li>
                                <li>The number of times the price touches the level.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Main Strategies for Level Trading</h2>
                            <p>
                                Level trading is based on two main approaches: trading within a range and trading level
                                breakouts.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Trading Within a Range</h3>
                            <p>
                                If a support level is identified, trade from it toward buying until a breakout occurs.
                                For trading within
                                a range, adhere to the following rules:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Avoid selling at support levels, as most price reversals happen upward.</li>
                                <li>The target is the opposite level (resistance).</li>
                                <li>Avoid trading during the influence of fundamental factors (news, central bank
                                    statements).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Trading Level Breakouts</h3>
                            <p>
                                A level breakout always starts with an impulsive price movement. Key signs of a breakout
                                include:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A sharp increase in volumes.</li>
                                <li>An impulsive movement in the breakout direction.</li>
                                <li>The price returns for a retest of the level (in 99% of cases).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                After the level retest, open a trade in the breakout direction. Set your <a

                                (for selling) or
                                below (for buying) the level.
                            </p>
