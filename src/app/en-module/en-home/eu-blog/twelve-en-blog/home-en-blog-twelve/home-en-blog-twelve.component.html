                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today I will talk about trading levels for beginner
                        traders. I will
                        explain how to draw levels, how to use them, and what they mean.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">What is a Level?</h3>
                    <p>First, let's understand what a level is. A level is a place on the chart where the price has
                        changed direction. For
                        example, the price was rising, reached a certain point, and then sharply turned downward. We can
                        draw two lines
                        across this range, showing that the market met resistance at this point and reversed. The
                        sharper and more impulsive
                        the price change, the higher the quality of the level. To draw good levels, you need to find
                        points on the chart
                        where there has been a sharp price change. Such levels can be considered high-probability and
                        used for trades.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Rules for Working with Levels</h3>
                    <p>The first thing to understand is that a level reflects value. Market participants, forming
                        levels, determine what is
                        considered expensive and what is cheap in the market. The market moves between these two values.
                        As long as market
                        participants consider one price to be expensive and the other to be cheap, the price will
                        fluctuate between these
                        levels. A support level acts as support when the price turns upward and as resistance when the
                        price turns downward.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Ways to Work with Levels</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="orange">Bounce from the Level:</span> traders work within the range, from level
                            to level.</li>
                        <li><span class="orange">Breakout of the Level:</span> support is broken, sellers take control
                            of the market, and
                            after a retest, a downward movement forms.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Now let's consider how to work within the range and during level breakouts.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Working Within the Range</h3>
                    <p>If we have identified a support level, remember that we work from support towards purchases until
                        we see a breakout.
                        Until the breakout occurs, we consider the level as support and do not sell into it, as this
                        contradicts statistics.
                        In most cases, the level repels the price, and a breakout occurs less frequently than a bounce.
                        Therefore, it is
                        better to work within the range on a bounce from the level.</p>

                    <p>The goals in such an analysis are simple: if two key levels are identified — cheap and expensive
                        — you can work from
                        one level to another without predicting additional scenarios. We are only concerned with the
                        current value shown by
                        the market. If the level is not broken, you can continue trading in this range until the market
                        is influenced by
                        fundamental factors, such as news or central bank statements.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Breakout of the Level</h3>
                    <p>A breakout always starts impulsively. This is the first factor indicating a breakout. Market
                        participants working
                        from purchases fix losses, which is accompanied by increased volumes. The price sharply goes
                        down but almost always
                        returns for a retest of the level. In 99% of cases, a retest occurs. Traders should work based
                        on the statistics of
                        trades, not on each individual trade, so skipping a few trades due to the absence of a retest is
                        not critical.</p>

                    <p>In conclusion, I want to say that levels are key price ranges where the price reverses. You
                        should work from level to
                        level until a breakout occurs.</p>
