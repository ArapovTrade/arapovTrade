                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello, friends! I'm Igor Arapov, and today I will talk about market <span
                            class="orange">overbought</span> and <span class="orange">oversold</span>
                        conditions.</p>

                    <p>First of all, I want to say that I view this topic with irony, as it is related to indicators.
                        The most popular of
                        them is the <span class="orange">Relative Strength Index (RSI)</span>. I've already explained
                        why I don't use such
                        indicators, but considering
                        their popularity, I think it's important to express my opinion. Perhaps, after this, someone
                        will reconsider using
                        these indicators.</p>

                    <p>Firstly, the main task of oscillators like RSI is to determine when market assets are overvalued
                        or undervalued. The
                        indicator itself is not that simple. It uses data from the last 14 bars to determine the range.
                        Values above 75 are
                        considered overbought (a signal to sell), and below 25 are considered oversold (a signal to
                        buy). Thus, the
                        indicator tries to explain its complex calculations.</p>

                    <p>Sometimes traders also look for <span class="orange"> divergences </span> — situations where the
                        price is rising, but the
                        indicator is not. If
                        divergence works, the indicator succeeds in prediction.</p>

                    <p>However, I want to say that divergences don't always work. Overbought and oversold are very
                        relative concepts,
                        especially when viewed through the eyes of an indicator limited to 14 bars. To make sense of
                        this, it's better to
                        use levels. Don't complicate your life — if there is momentum, just define the levels and that's
                        it. Why do you need
                        an indicator to understand, for example, that it's not worth selling the euro right now?</p>

                    <p>I think that beginners use indicators because of their psychology. They are afraid to make their
                        own decisions
                        because the market often shows them that they are wrong. It's easier for them to believe in
                        indicators. If they have
                        an indicator signal, they can say: "That's why I'm in a drawdown, it's not my fault, I was just
                        following the
                        indicator." Recognize yourself? I did that too.</p>

                    <p>Indicators give the illusion of justified decisions, but the result is often disappointing. If
                        they really worked, I
                        wouldn't be telling you about complex methods like volume analysis or <span class="orange">Smart
                            Money</span> strategies. We
                        would just use
                        indicators and follow their signals. But reality is more complicated.</p>

                    <p>Market prices are determined by common sense, your eyes, and your brain. If you shift
                        responsibility to indicators,
                        you are doomed to fail. You can blame the indicators all you want, but it won't help.</p>

                    <p>So, we've discussed divergences that sometimes work and sometimes don't. Here's an example: in
                        2013-2014, the euro
                        was worth about 1.4 dollars per euro. Then the ECB started lowering the rate, and the euro fell
                        to parity. RSI was
                        constantly showing oversold conditions, but the euro kept falling. This greatly undermined my
                        trust in the
                        indicator. Therefore, I advise not to rely too much on such things.</p>
