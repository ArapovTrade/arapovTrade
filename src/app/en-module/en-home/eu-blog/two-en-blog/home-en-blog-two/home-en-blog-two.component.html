                            <h2>What is Divergence?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Divergence occurs when the price on a chart moves in one direction, while the indicator
                                shows the opposite
                                movement. This discrepancy can signal a weakening trend and a possible reversal.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Types of Divergence</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Bullish Divergence:</strong> The price forms a lower low, while the
                                    indicator forms a higher
                                    low. This is a signal to buy.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bearish Divergence:</strong> The price forms a higher high, while the
                                    indicator forms a lower
                                    high. This is a signal to sell.</li>
                                <li><strong>Hidden Divergence:</strong> Confirms trend continuation. For example,
                                    bullish hidden divergence
                                    occurs when the price forms a higher low, while the indicator forms a lower low.
