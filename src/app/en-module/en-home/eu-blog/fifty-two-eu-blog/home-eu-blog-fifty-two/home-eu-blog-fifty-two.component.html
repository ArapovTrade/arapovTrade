                    </h1>

                    <h3 class="orange"></h3>
                    <p>Hello everyone! Today, we will talk about how trends work according to the <strong
                            class="orange">Wyckoff</strong> method. In
                        previous articles, we have already discussed that the market has two phases: <strong
                            class="orange">accumulation</strong> and <strong class="orange">distribution</strong>. Smart
                        money buys cheaply
                        during the accumulation phase and sells at a higher price during the distribution phase,
                        profiting from this. Today,
                        we will understand what happens inside these phases and how to use this information to make a
                        profit.</p>

                    <p>First of all, the scheme I will show you today is classic. About 80 years ago, Richard <strong
                            class="orange">Wyckoff</strong> formed this structure. At that time, there was no Forex, no
                        futures, no
                        computers, and no mobile phones. People traded on traditional exchanges, where life moved more
                        slowly. Today,
                        technology has significantly sped up our lives, and the exchange operates much faster. Now,
                        every trader has the
                        necessary terminals on their phone, and an order can be executed in fractions of a second.</p>

                    <p>However, there are aspects that will never change as long as the market exists, and aspects that
                        can be ignored
                        because they are no longer as relevant.</p>

                    <p>The first thing to understand is that there are points on the chart where smart money will try to
                        buy. They do this
                        quickly and in large quantities, as much as the market allows. This is an element of greed: they
                        want to buy cheaply
                        to later sell at a higher price in an inefficient market. These points are called <strong
                            class="orange">value
                            areas</strong>. The <strong class="orange">market profile</strong> methodology, developed by
                        Peter Steidlmayer,
                        defines value areas as zones of maximum trading volume.</p>

                    <p>For large players, it is important to find zones where they can buy without moving the price. In
                        the past, this
                        happened slowly, but now time is a variable in the "price + volume" formula. Large capital still
                        needs price and
                        volume, but the time it takes to obtain this liquidity can vary.</p>

                    <p>Now let's analyze the anatomy of the market. Large players need liquidity, and price determines
                        where it is
                        profitable for them to buy or sell. During the accumulation phase, a large player buys, and when
                        liquidity runs out,
                        the trend changes. Large players buy cheaply and sell at a high price, but they do not sell
                        during this time.</p>

                    <p>When the market is active, time does not play a significant role. For example, if there has been
                        a strong decline,
                        large players can quickly buy, and the price will shoot up. In another situation, activity may
                        be lower, and
                        accumulation will take more time. But the essence remains the same: large money needs liquidity.
                    </p>

                    <p>It is also important to understand that volumes in the cryptocurrency market may be fake. This is
                        a problem since
                        there is no regulation, and it is difficult to understand how honest everything is. Therefore,
                        always check volumes
                        for common sense.</p>

                    <p>Now let's move on to <strong class="orange">value areas</strong> and <strong
                            class="orange">orders</strong>. In the
                        accumulation zone, we are interested in "sell stops" â€” market orders that push the price down.
                        These orders form the
                        value area where large players can place their orders. If all the parameters align, then the
                        selling value area,
                        where the crowd is actively selling, becomes the buying area for large players. This will lead
                        to a price increase,
                        indicating that the asset is undervalued.</p>

                    <p>I hope this is clear. Now let's define liquidity. If we have an accumulation phase where a large
                        player was buying,
                        sooner or later, liquidity will run out, and the trend will change. Large players buy cheaply
                        and sell at a high
                        price, and they need liquidity for this. When the market is in strong hands, there can be no
                        talk of a decline.
                        There may be local declines, but the trend will continue.</p>

                    <p>That's all for now. In the next articles, we will talk about shakeouts and how big money shakes
                        out small traders.
                    </p>
