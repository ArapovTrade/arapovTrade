                                    stop orders, and lose money due to liquidity manipulation.
                                </p>

                                        entries.</li>
                                    <li>Avoid placing stop orders in obvious locations (beyond local highs and lows).
                                    </li>

                                            Blocks</a> </strong> are key
                                    zones on the chart where
                                    major
                                    institutional players (banks,
                                    hedge funds, market makers) accumulated or distributed their positions before
                                    a significant market movement. They
                                    represent the last candles before an impulse and often become support or
                                    resistance zones where
                                    price returns before continuing the trend. </p>
                                <p> Order Blocks allow retail traders to identify areas where Smart Money is likely
                                    to enter the market. These levels
                                    have high liquidity as they concentrate a large number of
                                    orders, making them key
                                    zones for finding entry points into trades. </p>

                                <h3>How to Identify an Order Block?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Bullish Order Block:</strong> The last bearish candle before a strong
                                        rally. Indicates where large
                                        players bought an asset before the start of an uptrend.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Bearish Order Block:</strong> The last bullish candle before a strong
                                        decline. Indicates the zone where
                                        Smart Money opened short positions before a downtrend.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Strong impulse after Order Block:</strong> The price movement following
                                        the Order Block should be sharp and
                                        accompanied by high volumes, confirming the activity of major players.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Price returns to the Order Block:</strong> After breaking a level, the
                                        price often retests the Order Block
                                        before continuing the trend.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Confluence with liquidity zones:</strong> If the Order Block aligns
                                        with liquidity clusters,
                                        its probability of success increases.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Wait for the retest of the Order Block:</strong> Do not enter the market
                                        immediately; allow the price to return to the Order Block zone for confirmation.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Use candlestick confirmation patterns:</strong> Pin bars, engulfing
                                        patterns, and price reaction to
                                        the Order Block increase the likelihood of a successful entry.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Analyze volumes:</strong> Monitor volume during the Order Block retest –
                                        if high volumes appear, this confirms the strength of the level.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use additional filters:</strong> Combine Order Blocks with Break of
                                        Structure (BOS) and
                                        Change of Character (CHoCH) for greater accuracy.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Place stop-loss beyond the Order Block:</strong> Set the stop-loss
                                        behind the last candle of the Order
                                        Block and take-profit at the nearest liquidity zone.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    Order Blocks are a crucial element of Smart Money Concepts, allowing traders
                                    to follow
                                    institutional players,
                                    improving entry accuracy and reducing the risk of trading against the trend.
                                    Combining Order Blocks with other SMC elements can help build
                                    effective trading strategies and identify profitable market entry points.

                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/pricingandliquidity">Liquidity</a>
                                    plays a key role in the Smart Money strategy. Large
                                    players cannot
                                    simply enter the market with a large
                                    volume without significant slippage, so they create conditions to collect
                                    liquidity from retail
                                    traders. They intentionally push the price into zones where stop orders are
                                    placed, trigger them, and then initiate
                                    movement in their desired direction. </p>
                                <p> Understanding how liquidity works allows traders to find favorable
                                    entry points, avoid false
                                    breakouts, and trade in alignment with major players. </p>

                                <h3>Where to Look for Liquidity?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Beyond support and resistance levels:</strong> Most traders
                                        place stop orders beyond
                                        key levels, making them attractive for Smart Money.</li>
                                    <li><strong>In ranges (consolidation):</strong> Before a strong impulse move,
                                        price often accumulates
                                        liquidity within a range, creating false breakouts.</li>
                                    <li><strong>At daily and weekly extremes:</strong> Large players often
                                        use local highs and
                                        lows to collect liquidity and open large positions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>At high-volume zones:</strong> If the price approaches a level
                                        with significant accumulated volume,
                                        it may be a point of interest for Smart Money.</li>
                                    <li><strong>At psychological levels:</strong> Round numbers (e.g., 1.2000,
                                        50,000) often act as
                                        liquidity zones, as many stop orders are placed there.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>How to Trade Using Liquidity?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Wait for stop-loss hunting (Liquidity Sweep):</strong> Before entering
                                        a trade, wait for a liquidity manipulation – a sharp move beyond a key level
                                        followed by a reversal.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use confirmation signals:</strong> Enter a trade only after a
                                        confirmation pattern,
                                        such as a pin bar, false breakout, or engulfing candlestick pattern.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Monitor volumes:</strong> Increased volume at liquidity levels
                                        confirms the presence
                                        of major players.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Place stop-loss beyond the nearest extreme:</strong> The stop-loss
                                        should be set beyond the last
                                        liquidity zone to avoid premature stop-outs.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Set targets at the next liquidity zone:</strong> Place take-profit
                                        near the next level,
                                        where liquidity collection or a potential reversal is likely.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>
                                    Understanding liquidity zones helps traders avoid mistakes related to entering
                                    the market on false breakouts
                                    and increases the probability of successful trades.

                                    <li><strong>Bullish FVG:</strong> Forms when the price makes a sharp upward impulse,
                                        leaving a gap between
                                        the low of the first candle and the high of the third candle.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Bearish FVG:</strong> Occurs during a rapid decline when an unfilled gap
                                        remains between the high
                                        of the first candle and the low of the third candle.</li>
                                    <li><strong>The stronger the impulse, the more significant the FVG:</strong> If the
                                        movement
                                        was accompanied by high volume and
                                        aggressive volatility, the FVG zone becomes more reliable.</li>
                                    <li><strong>FVGs are often tested:</strong> The price tends to return to these zones
                                        to fill the gap before
                                        continuing the trend.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Analyze volumes:</strong> If the price enters the FVG zone and starts
                                        slowing down on increased
                                        volume, it may be a signal for entry.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Combine FVG with Order Blocks:</strong> If the FVG zone coincides with
                                        an Order Block, it increases
                                        the probability of a bounce and successful price movement in your direction.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Use confirmation signals:</strong> Watch for candlestick patterns
                                        (engulfing, pin bar) and
                                        reactions at the FVG level.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Place stop-loss wisely:</strong> It is best to place it beyond
                                        the FVG zone or behind
                                        the nearest extreme.</li>

                                <h2>How to Enter Trades Using Break of Structure (BOS)?</h2>
                                <p> <strong>Break of Structure (BOS)</strong> is a breakout of a key high or
                                    low that confirms
                                    trend continuation. Smart Money use BOS as confirmation of their strategy
                                    before entering the market. This
                                    is an important signal for traders, helping them determine whether the trend
                                    is continuing or a correction
                                    should be expected. </p>
                                <p> Unlike regular breakouts, BOS indicates not just a level breakout but a change
                                    in market structure. If the breakout
                                    is accompanied by volume and a further impulsive movement, it signals a
                                    high-probability trade. </p>

                                <h3>How to Identify BOS?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Bullish BOS:</strong> The price breaks the previous high, confirming
                                        an uptrend and buyer interest.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Bearish BOS:</strong> The price breaks the previous low, signaling
                                        a downtrend and
                                        selling pressure.</li>
                                    <li><strong>There must be a strong impulsive movement:</strong> The breakout should
                                        occur with high volatility
                                        and volume.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Retest of the level:</strong> The price often returns to the broken
                                        level to test it before
                                        continuing the trend.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Additional signals:</strong> Confirming factors include
                                        volume, candlestick patterns, and
                                        liquidity presence.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Wait for a breakout of a key level:</strong> Ensure the price has broken
                                        an important level and consolidated
                                        above (or below) it.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Watch for a retest:</strong> The price often returns to the broken level
                                        before moving in the
                                        trend direction.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Analyze the reaction:</strong> If confirmation candlestick patterns
                                        (engulfing,
                                        pin bar) appear on the retest, a trade entry is possible.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use volume analysis:</strong> High volume at the breakout and
                                        subsequent retest confirms
                                        Smart Money intentions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Stop-loss and take-profit:</strong> Place the stop-loss behind the
                                        nearest extreme and take-profit
                                        near the next liquidity zone.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    Trading using BOS allows traders to enter the market with trend confirmation,
                                    avoiding false breakouts. When combined
                                    with liquidity analysis,
                                    Order Blocks, and Fair Value Gaps, BOS enables the creation of strategies with

                                <h2>How to Use Change of Character (CHoCH) for Trade Entry?</h2>
                                <p> <strong>Change of Character (CHoCH)</strong> is one of the key signals in Smart
                                    Money Concepts that
                                    indicates a possible shift in market direction. Unlike <strong>Break
                                        of Structure (BOS)</strong>,
                                    which confirms a trend movement, CHoCH signals a transition from one
                                    market phase to another – from
                                    an uptrend to a downtrend or vice versa. </p>
                                <p> CHoCH is used for early trend reversal detection and is an excellent
                                    tool for entering the market at the beginning
                                    of a new trend. This signal is particularly useful when analyzing liquidity zones
                                    and
                                    confirming the intentions of major
                                    players (Smart Money). </p>

                                <h3>How to Identify CHoCH?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Bullish CHoCH:</strong> The price stops forming lower lows and
                                        breaks the previous
                                        high, indicating a trend reversal upward.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Bearish CHoCH:</strong> The price stops forming higher
                                        highs and breaks the previous
                                        low, signaling a downward reversal.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Market structure shift:</strong> CHoCH is often accompanied by trend
                                        slowdowns and the formation of accumulation or distribution zones.</li>
                                    <li><strong>CHoCH aligns with liquidity zones:</strong> Before a market reversal,
                                        Smart Money often triggers
                                        stop orders of retail traders, creating false breakouts.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Volume confirmation:</strong> If the reversal is accompanied by
                                        increasing
                                        volume, the probability
                                        of a successful trade significantly increases.</li>

                                        returns to this zone before
                                        continuing the trend.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Monitor liquidity:</strong> If stop orders are triggered before your
                                        entry,
                                        it may indicate Smart Money activity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use confirmation signals:</strong> Combine candlestick patterns
                                        (engulfing, pin bar),
                                        volume analysis, and cluster charts to strengthen the signal.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Place the stop-loss beyond the liquidity zone:</strong> This protects
                                        you from
                                        being stopped out before
                                        the price moves in your favor.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Example of Strategy Combination:</h3>
                                <p>
                                    1. The price breaks an important level (BOS), signaling a trend change.<br>
                                    2. It then returns to the Order Block, where major players previously accumulated
                                    positions.<br>
                                    3. An unclosed Fair Value Gap (FVG) is also in this area, strengthening
                                    the probability of a bounce.<br>
                                    4. Before the retest of the Order Block, retail traders’ stop orders are triggered,
                                    confirming Smart
                                    Money activity.<br>
                                    5. Market entry occurs after the appearance of a confirmation candlestick pattern or
                                    increased volume.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    By combining these elements, traders can filter out false breakouts,
                                    find more accurate entry points,
                                    and follow Smart Money
                                    rather than trading against them.

                                <h2>Risk Management in Smart Money Concepts Trading</h2>
                                <p> Proper risk management is a key aspect of successful trading. Even the best
                                    entry points will not bring
                                    consistent profits if a trader does not control losses and manage
                                    capital effectively. Smart Money Concepts
                                    (SMC) involve understanding market structure, but without proper risk management,
                                    trading turns into
                                    gambling. </p>

                                <h3>Key Risk Management Rules:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Risk per trade no more than 1-2%:</strong> An optimal value for
                                        preserving capital in the long run.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Placing stop-loss beyond liquidity zones:</strong> This protects
                                        the position from being stopped out before
                                        the real market movement.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Using risk/reward ratio:</strong> The minimum ratio should be 1:2 or
                                        higher
                                        to gain an advantage over a series of trades.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Partial position closure:</strong> Lock in profits at key levels while
                                        keeping part of the trade open for further movement.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Applying trailing stop-loss:</strong> Helps maximize profit
                                        during strong trending movements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Analyzing liquidity before entry:</strong> Avoid entering the market
                                        during high volatility periods (e.g., before major news releases).</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>How to Manage Risks in Real Trading?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    When using Smart Money Concepts, it is essential to recognize that major players
                                    manipulate price movements and often create false
                                    breakouts before real market moves.
                                    Therefore, stop orders should be placed beyond strong levels rather than at
                                    predictable
                                    locations.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Market context should also be considered – if a high liquidity zone has formed on
                                    the chart,
                                    the probability of a false breakout increases, and it is better to wait for a
                                    confirming signal
                                    before entering.

                                        and distribution zones.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Finding liquidity zones:</strong> Recognizing areas where stop orders
                                        are concentrated, attracting Smart
                                        Money.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Using Order Blocks and FVG:</strong> Identifying entry points based on
                                        institutional demand and supply.</li>

                                    level
                                    and achieve consistent
