                    </h1>
                    <h3 class="orange">Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov</h3>
                    <p>Today we're going to talk about the importance of a <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> as
                        a protective order.
                        I've been trading on the market for over 11 years and I want to share my experience, especially
                        with beginner
                        traders, why it's such an important tool and how to use it.</p>
                    <p>First, it's important to understand that a <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> is your
                        friend. It protects your
                        deposit from losses. The most important thing is to have a <strong
                            class="orange">stop-loss</strong> in every trade.
                        Without it, if the market changes dramatically due to news or actions by the Central Bank, you
                        could find yourself
                        in an unfavorable situation and lose more money than planned. To avoid this, a <strong
                            class="orange">stop-loss</strong> is necessary.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, many beginner traders don't use a <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong>
                        because they don't know
                        how to set it correctly. The market often hits stops if they are set incorrectly. Beginners see
                        the price
                        fluctuating and place orders randomly, hoping for profit. But when the market goes against them,
                        they are trapped.
                    </p>
                    <p>A <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> is a protection tool, and its installation should be
                        part of the plan.
                        Every trader has a trading strategy that includes a trading plan. If you don't have one, check
                        out my videos on the
                        channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArapovTrade"
                            class="orange dec">youtube.com/&#64;ArapovTrade</a>. I've
                        recorded many trading systems, including the Smart Money concept. The principle of setting a
                        <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> is related to the Smart Money concept, as there are
                        smart participants in the
                        market who manipulate prices.
                    </p>
                    <p>On the gold chart <a href="https://youtu.be/XYNyIUZ6nVc?si=JuJG0TtLC-o6hpgv"
                            class="orange dec">youtube.com</a> I
                        showed a level or price range. You can see how the price often touches this level, falls below
                        the minimums, there's
                        a large volume of sales, and then a sharp return. This is a false break when smart participants
                        take the <strong class="orange">stop-losses</strong> of traders who have set them incorrectly.
                        To avoid this trap, wait for
                        manipulation at the level and set your <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> after that. A
                        false break of the
                        level is a signal to watch the market and prepare for buying. The <strong
                            class="orange">stop-loss</strong> can be
                        set behind a high volume. When professionals have collected all stops, the price will not return
                        there. This is the
                        market's bottom. A false break is the extreme point of the chart, and you can use this pattern
                        for correct <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> setting.</p>
                    <p>If you trade a false break, bought, and the market goes lower, it means you have incorrectly
                        identified the false
                        break, but the <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> will protect you from major losses. In
                        our example, it was
                        the market's bottom, and gold went up after the false break. Manipulation knocks out the stops
                        of inexperienced
                        traders, and after that, you can confidently set your <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong>.
                        To be protected,
                        patience is needed. At a critical level where the price constantly touches, the market awaits
                        this action. After
                        that, the trend begins.</p>
                    <p>In volume analysis, this action is called "shakeout." Professionals push the price lower to knock
                        out those who
                        bought in that range, and then buy these sales. The trend changes from sideways to a growth
                        phase. The key rule for
                        a <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> is to place it where the price will not return. A
                        false break of a key
                        level is a signal. If you have patience, you will wait for inexperienced traders to be knocked
                        out, understand the
                        intentions of large players, and join them.</p>
                    <p>My recommendation for beginners: <strong class="orange">stop-losses</strong> are very important.
                        You cannot trade
                        without a <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong>, otherwise, you risk your deposit. The main
                        thing is to set the
                        <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> consciously. I provided an example of a conscious
                        <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> on the gold chart, where there was manipulation at the
                        level, showing the
                        market's bottom. This was a great opportunity to join a new movement and set a <strong
                            class="orange">stop-loss</strong> that will protect you if something changes. With this
                        approach, you will
                        always have a good risk to reward ratio.
