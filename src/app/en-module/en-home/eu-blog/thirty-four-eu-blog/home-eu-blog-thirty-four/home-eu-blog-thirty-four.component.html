                <h1>What is Stop-Loss and How to Set It Properly</h1>

                <p>
                  A <dfn>stop-loss</dfn> is one of the key risk management tools
                  in trading. Its proper configuration helps protect capital and
                  avoid significant losses. This tool is especially important
                  for both beginners and experienced traders as it prevents
                  large losses during unfavorable price movements. To understand
                  this topic more deeply, I recommend studying

                <p>
                  A stop-loss is an automatic order that closes a trader's
                  position when the asset price reaches a predetermined level.
                  The main purpose of a stop-loss is to limit losses and protect
                  capital from significant drawdowns. This tool minimizes
                  losses, protects capital from depletion during sharp
                  movements, disciplines the trader, and automates the trading
                  process completely.

                <h2>Stop-Loss Placement Strategies</h2>

                <p>
                  Several proven stop-loss placement strategies exist, each
                  suitable for different trading types and risk levels.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Fixed percentage of capital is the most popular method. The
                  trader predetermines what percentage of the deposit they are
                  willing to risk per trade. The optimal value is 1-2% of
                  capital. If the deposit is $10,000 and risk is 2%, the maximum
                  loss per trade should not exceed $200.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Stop-loss by support and resistance levels is based on
                  technical analysis. The protective order is placed beyond key
                  technical levels. If an asset moves in an uptrend with nearest
                  support at $1,500, the stop-loss is placed slightly below, for
                  example at $1,480.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Volatility-based stop-loss accounts for market fluctuations.
                  The <dfn>ATR</dfn> (Average True Range) indicator is used for
                  this purpose. If ATR shows 50 points, the stop-loss is set at
                  1.5-2 ATR distance from entry point, allowing avoidance of
                  random stops during natural price fluctuations. I also
                  recommend studying
                  <a
                    class="linkrefinto"

                <h2>How to Calculate Stop-Loss Size</h2>

                <p>
                  Proper stop-loss calculation is critically important for
                  trading success. Calculation errors lead either to premature
                  trade closure or excessive losses that can damage the trading
                  account.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Fixed percentage formula: Stop-loss size in points = (Risk
                  percentage × Deposit) ÷ Position volume. With a $10,000
                  deposit and 2% risk, maximum loss is $200. If buying 100
                  shares, stop-loss is set 2 points from entry.
                </p>

                <p>
                  ATR-based calculation accounts for current volatility. With
                  <a
                    class="linkrefinto"
                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/atrindikator"
                    >ATR</a
                  >
                  at 50 points, stop-loss at 1.5 × ATR = 75 points provides
                  protection against random stops while giving the trade room to
                  breathe.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Always check <dfn>risk to reward ratio</dfn> (Risk/Reward
                  Ratio). The optimal value is at least 1:2. If expected profit
                  is 100 points, risk should not exceed 50 points.
                </p>

                <h2>Common Stop-Loss Mistakes</h2>

                <p>
                  Incorrect stop-loss placement can lead to frequent losses even
                  with a profitable trading strategy. Avoiding these common
                  errors is essential for trading success.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Too tight stop-loss is one of the main beginner mistakes. If
                  the protective order is too close to entry, even a small
                  correction will close the position at a loss, though price may
                  then continue in the desired direction.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Too wide stop-loss leads to significant losses on unfavorable
                  moves. If stop-loss is set at 50% of capital, one unsuccessful
                  trade can cost half the deposit, making recovery extremely
                  difficult.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Placement at obvious levels makes traders vulnerable to
                  manipulation. Many place stop-losses right at round numbers
                  where many orders concentrate. Better to place slightly below
                  or above key levels to avoid stop hunting.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Moving stop-loss to increase potential loss is a dangerous
                  practice that can lead to catastrophic account destruction.
                  Set stop-loss at a justified level and do not change it
                  without clear technical reason.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Ignoring market volatility leads to frequent stop-loss hits.
                  Always account for current volatility using the ATR indicator
                  and adjust the distance appropriately.
                </p>

                <p>
                  No stop-loss is the most dangerous mistake. Some traders hope
                  to close trades manually, but sharp market movements can lead
                  to complete deposit loss within minutes.
                </p>

                <h2>Stop-Loss for Different Trading Styles</h2>

                <p>
                  Each trading style requires an individual approach to
                  stop-loss placement based on typical holding periods and
                  volatility exposure.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For scalping , recommended stop-loss size is 0.2-0.5% of asset
                  price. Important to use technical indicators and place
                  protective order beyond nearest support or resistance levels.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For intraday trading, optimal stop-loss size is 0.5-1.5% of
                  price. Use levels on higher timeframes (H1, H4) and apply
                  <dfn>trailing stop</dfn> for profit protection as trade
                  develops.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For swing trading spanning several days to weeks, wider
                  stop-losses of 2-5% of price are appropriate. Consider
                  fundamental analysis and important news events that may impact
                  price.
                </p>

                <p>
                  For long-term investing, stop-loss size can be 10-20% of
                  price. Use fundamental analysis and macroeconomic factors,
                  placing stop-loss below long-term support levels.
                </p>

                <h2>Adapting Stop-Loss to Market Conditions</h2>

                <p>
                  Markets do not always behave the same way, and successful
                  traders adapt their stop-losses to current conditions for
                  optimal results.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In trending markets, use trailing stop to lock in profits as
                  trend continues. Place stop-loss behind the last local minimum
                  for longs or maximum for shorts. Use moving averages to
                  determine dynamic levels.
                </p>

                <p>
                  In ranging markets, place stop-loss beyond the range
                  boundaries, considering support and resistance levels. Use
                  smaller stop-loss size since price movements are limited
                  within the range.
                </p>

                <p>
                  During high volatility, widen stop-loss to avoid random stops.
                  Use ATR for adaptation and avoid opening new trades during
                  major news releases when spreads widen.
                </p>

                <h2>Combining Stop-Loss with Other Tools</h2>

                <p>
                  Successful trading requires more than just setting a
                  stop-loss. It is important to combine it with other risk
                  management tools for comprehensive protection.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Always determine risk to reward ratio before entering a trade.
                  With a 50-point stop-loss, <dfn>take-profit</dfn> should be at
                  least 100 points for a 1:2 ratio ensuring positive expectancy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Do not invest all capital in one trade — diversify risks
                  across different assets and timeframes. Never risk more than
                  2% of deposit per single trade.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Limit daily losses to protect psychological capital. If you
                  lost a certain percentage of deposit in a day, stop and
                  analyze mistakes. Optimal daily loss limit is 3-5% of deposit.
                </p>

                <h2>Analyzing Stop-Loss Triggers</h2>

                <p>
                  Even with proper stop-loss placement, situations occur when it
                  triggers too often. Analyzing causes helps adjust strategy and
                  avoid unnecessary losses going forward.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Keeping a trading journal is one of the best ways to improve
                  strategy. Record entry and exit points, stop-loss and
                  take-profit levels, reason for entering position, trade
                  result, and market circumstances.
                </p>

                <p>
                  If stop-loss triggers too often, analyze possible causes: too
                  tight stop-loss without considering volatility, placement at
                  obvious levels where market often collects liquidity, or
                  trading against the trend.
                </p>

                <h2>Psychological Aspects</h2>

                <p>
                  Stop-loss is not only a technical tool but also psychological
                  protection for the trader. Proper stop-loss use helps avoid
                  emotional decisions and stick to the
                  <a
                    class="linkrefinto"

                    >trading plan</a
                  >.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Many traders are tempted to move stop-loss hoping price will
                  reverse. This is one of the most dangerous mistakes.
                  Discipline in following the set stop-loss is a sign of
                  professional trading approach.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Accepting losses as part of the trading process is an
                  important psychological skill. No strategy guarantees 100%
                  profitable trades. Stop-loss allows controlling loss size and
                  preserving capital.
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>

                <p>
                  Stop-loss is not just a tool but a crucial part of risk
                  management system. Choose stop-loss strategy based on your
                  trading style, calculate it based on risk, levels, and
                  volatility.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Do not place stop-loss too close to entry point, analyze
                  market before placement, use trailing stop for profit
                  protection. Keep a trading journal to analyze triggers and
                  adjust strategy. To consolidate this material, study also

                <p>
                  Remember that stop-loss is not a guarantee against losses but
                  a tool to minimize them. The key to successful trading is
                  discipline, analysis, and constant strategy improvement
                  through practice.
