                            beginners</span>
                    </h1>


                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov and today I want to discuss the <strong
                            class="orange">risks associated with investing in
                            cryptocurrencies</strong>. Many beginners who come into trading, especially in
                        cryptocurrencies, do so through
                        advertising or advice from friends without fully understanding all the risks. This often ends in
                        failure. Today I
                        want to explain these risks. This is not a criticism of cryptocurrencies, but an objective
                        reality that should be
                        considered if you are going to invest your money in this area.</p>
                    <p>Let's start with the fact that cryptocurrencies are traded on exchanges, but they are not yet
                        protected by law. For
                        government regulators, they remain an uncertain asset. By buying cryptocurrency, you are
                        essentially buying
                        something whose real value is unclear. In classical financial theory, investments are associated
                        with acquiring
                        intrinsic value, which is often simply not present here. Cryptocurrency only has a price.</p>
                    <p>What happens next? It often happens that prices rise rapidly and then fall just as quickly.
                        Without legal protection
                        and regulation, the market can resemble a casino. Coin issuers can manipulate the market by
                        controlling supply and
                        demand. This creates conditions for rapid price changes and opportunities to make money on this.
                        However, such
                        markets can be dangerous for those who do not understand the full depth of the risks.</p>
                    <p>When cryptocurrency prices change sharply, the desire to make money can lead to dangerous
                        decisions. People sometimes
                        buy at peaks, hoping for further growth, but ultimately lose money due to a rapid price drop.
                        This highlights the
                        importance of understanding all aspects of risk and the need to know what you are doing before
                        investing in
                        cryptocurrencies.</p>
