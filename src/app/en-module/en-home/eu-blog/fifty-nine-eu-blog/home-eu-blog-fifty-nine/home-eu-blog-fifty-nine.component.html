                            trading</span>
                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today I’ll be talking about <strong
                            class="orange">breakouts</strong>. I’ve previously
                        written about working with levels and the <strong class="orange">pin bar</strong>. Today, I want
                        to combine these
                        topics and discuss the <strong class="orange">pin bar</strong>, <strong
                            class="orange">volume</strong>, and <strong class="orange">breakouts</strong>. This
                        comprehensive approach will help you understand how and where to open a
                        trade.</p>

                    <p>If you prefer the <strong class="orange">breakout</strong> technique, the first step is to
                        identify the levels you
                        want to trade. <strong class="orange">Levels</strong> are key points that all market
                        participants pay attention to.
                        If you’re looking to trade a <strong class="orange">breakout</strong> and sell before the next
                        local level, you need
                        to wait for a few steps.</p>

                    <p>First, wait for the <strong class="orange">breakout</strong> of the level, and then the retest.
                        So, it’s <strong class="orange">breakout</strong>, <strong class="orange">retest</strong>, and
                        only then do you enter. Otherwise,
                        the price might just bounce back up, leaving you in a losing trade as the local trend reverses
                        sharply.</p>

                    <p>What should you look for after the pullback? The <strong class="orange">pin bar</strong> is an
                        excellent pattern in
                        technical analysis using Japanese candlesticks. It always indicates the market's inability to
                        move in either
                        direction.</p>

                    <p>If we expect buyers to control the market, this pattern should not appear at the level. It’s a
                        sign of weakness,
                        showing that buyers are unable to push prices higher. This is exactly the setup you should be
                        looking for when
                        trading a <strong class="orange">breakout</strong>.</p>

                    <p>First, wait for the <strong class="orange">breakout</strong>, preferably on high <strong
                            class="orange">volume</strong>. High volume indicates that market participants are
                        liquidating their positions
                        at a loss, their stops are being hit, and the price is dropping. After this, many traders try to
                        buy on the
                        pullback.</p>

                    <p>When you see the pullback, pay attention to the top of the retracement. If a <strong
                            class="orange">pin bar</strong>
                        or <strong class="orange">upthrust</strong> appears there, it’s a signal that buyers are
                        exhausted, and the price is
                        unlikely to go higher. This is your entry point. Place your sell order below the <strong
                            class="orange">pin
                            bar</strong> and your stop above it.</p>

                    <p>Your risk-to-reward ratio should be no less than 1 to 2. Ideally, choose quality <strong
                            class="orange">levels</strong> where you can achieve a ratio of 1 to 3.</p>

                    <p>The <strong class="orange">pin bar</strong> is a key pattern after a <strong
                            class="orange">breakout</strong>. Once
                        it forms, expect the price to move in its direction and trade in line with the <strong
                            class="orange">breakout</strong>.</p>
