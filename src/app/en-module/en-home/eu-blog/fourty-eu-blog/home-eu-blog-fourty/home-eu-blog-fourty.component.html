                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov and today I want to talk about <strong
                            class="orange">trading psychology</strong>. Those of
                        you who follow my channel know that I share my experience through educational videos available
                        for free for
                        self-study.</p>
                    <p>In this video, I want to share my thoughts on the journey of becoming a trader and its
                        development. Today we have a
                        somewhat philosophical approach. I just want to think aloud, recall my experience, and draw key
                        conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Once, in 2013 (now 2024), I started trading. Over these 11 years, much has changed, but the
                        basics remain unchanged:
                        “<strong class="orange">Japanese candlesticks</strong>”, “<strong class="orange">bars</strong>”,
                        “<strong class="orange">volumes</strong>”, “<strong class="orange">levels</strong>” — all the
                        same.</p>
                    <p>Professional money that existed then is the same now. The infrastructure has, of course, evolved:
                        more accurate
                        robots and new technologies have appeared. But for the ordinary trader, the basic principles
                        remain unchanged. I
                        have highlighted key points on my chart, the methodology is available on my Telegram channel for
                        free download and
                        study.</p>
                    <p>The market continues to fluctuate, beginners come and go, many lose deposits, but some become
                        successful traders
                        after training and experience.</p>
                    <p>Reflecting on this, I realized that paid training is preferable to free training due to the
                        important role of a
                        mentor. Beginner traders often take risks due to a lack of experience and knowledge, but a
                        mentor helps them develop
                        the right skills and manage their emotions.</p>
                    <p><strong class="orange">Psychology</strong> plays a key role in trading. From the absence of fear
                        in beginners to its
                        gradual accumulation with experience — this whole process requires support and mentorship.</p>
                    <p>So, if you are thinking about trading, learn from those who have already gone through this path.
                        It can become a
                        decisive moment in your success in the market.</p>
