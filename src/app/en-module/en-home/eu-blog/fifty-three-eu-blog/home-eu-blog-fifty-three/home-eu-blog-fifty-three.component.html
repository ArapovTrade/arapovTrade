                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today we will talk about <strong class="orange">order
                            blocks</strong>. This is a very
                        popular topic on the internet, and I want to share my thoughts on it.</p>

                    <p><strong class="orange">Order block</strong> is a part of the <strong class="orange">“Price
                            Action”</strong>
                        methodology, where we try to find large orders that can influence the price. The name speaks for
                        itself: an order
                        block is something large. In this video, we will discuss what it looks like and how it can be
                        used.</p>

                    <p>First of all, I have a <strong class="orange">volume</strong> indicator on my chart. This will
                        help us understand how
                        an order block forms because it's hard to see just by looking at the price alone. <strong
                            class="orange">Volume</strong> is a reaction to price, and somewhere at a certain price
                        point, there will be a
                        large order waiting to be executed.</p>

                    <p>Large market participants want to sell without affecting the price. For example, selling gold. We
                        see how the order
                        block pushed the price down. A large participant would prefer to sell without moving the price,
                        but an order block
                        forms where there isn't enough demand. Therefore, large orders have to be executed at market
                        prices, driving the
                        price down.</p>

                    <p><strong class="orange">Order block</strong> is a clever <strong class="orange">algorithmic
                            order</strong> that is
                        executed in a special way, and it takes experience to spot it. It doesn't form often because
                        most large orders are
                        executed with <strong class="orange">limit orders</strong> to avoid impacting the price. An
                        <strong class="orange">order block</strong> is an exception that is usually seen between major
                        levels when the new price
                        level is far off and large capital has no choice but to push the price through the market.
                    </p>

                    <p><strong class="orange">Order block</strong> starts with the first bar that sets the direction of
                        the order. At its
                        end, it touches the buyers. The <strong class="orange">algorithmic order</strong> hits the order
                        book, reaches the
                        nearest support level where there are buy orders, and these orders gradually push the price up.
                        Then the market is
                        tested under this demand for a while until it weakens, and the order begins to aggressively and
                        rapidly push through
                        the market.</p>

                    <p>This is a clever <strong class="orange">algorithmic order</strong>, and it takes practice to
                        recognize it. I provided
                        an example on gold where this is clearly visible. It's a rare occurrence, but if you see it,
                        make sure to use it, as
                        <strong class="orange">order blocks</strong> significantly change the price and are executed
                        where there are no
                        counterparts. In this case, there is not enough demand, and the <strong class="orange">order
                            block</strong> is
                        forced to push the price down. The price drop increases the number of sellers, and a mass of
                        orders drives the price
                        even lower.
                    </p>
