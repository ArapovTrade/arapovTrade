                        </header>
                        <p><strong>Fundamental analysis</strong> is a deep study of factors influencing the state of the
                            economy,
                            the development of industries, and the position of individual companies. It is a key tool
                            for long-term
                            investors,
                            allowing them to determine the fair value of assets and forecast market movements. In this
                            article,
                            we will examine what fundamental analysis includes, its advantages and disadvantages, and
                            why it is less often
                            used by traders focused on short-term strategies.</p>

                        <section>
                            <h2>What is Fundamental Analysis?</h2>
                            <p><strong>Fundamental analysis</strong> is a comprehensive approach that examines economic,
                                financial,
                                and political factors to understand the current state of the market and predict its
                                future.
                                It is applied in investments to evaluate the true value of an asset by comparing it with
                                the market price.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Main Levels of Analysis</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Company Level:</strong> Analysis of financial statements, management
                                    structure, and competitive
                                    advantages.</li>
                                <li><strong>Industry Level:</strong> Study of market conditions, trends, and competition
                                    levels.</li>
                                <li><strong>Macroeconomic Level:</strong> Assessment of GDP, inflation rate, employment,
                                    and other economic
                                    indicators.</li>
                                <li><strong>Global Factors:</strong> Influence of international policies, natural
                                    disasters, and other
                                    events.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Fundamental Analysis in Trading</h3>
                            <p>Traders more frequently use fundamental analysis for long-term investments. For example,
                                when trading stocks, this method helps identify companies with sustainable business
                                models and strong growth
                                prospects.
                                However, for short-term trading, it is less effective due to its long-term nature.</p>

                            <h2>Why is Fundamental Analysis Used Less Often?</h2>
                            <p>Despite its advantages, fundamental analysis is not as popular among traders, especially
                                those trading
                                short-term market fluctuations.
                                The main reasons include:</p>

                            <h3>Major Players in the Market</h3>
                            <p>As Richard Wyckoff noted, major operators have significant resources and can predict
                                market changes well in
                                advance.
                                They prepare for these changes ahead of time by leveraging privileged access to
                                information unavailable to
                                most market participants.</p>

                            <h3>Complexity of Analysis</h3>
                            <p>Fundamental analysis requires substantial time and knowledge. It involves analyzing vast
                                amounts of data,
                                ranging from corporate reports to geopolitical situations. Additionally, data may be
                                distorted, increasing
                                the risk of errors.</p>

                            <h3>The Role of Technical Analysis</h3>
                            <p><a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/technicalanalysis">Technical analysis</a>
                                is more practical for traders as it allows them to react instantly to changes in prices
                                and volumes.
                                This is particularly important for those working with short-term strategies.</p>

                        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                        <p>Fundamental analysis is a valuable tool for long-term investors, helping them make informed
                            decisions based on a
                            deep understanding of the market.
                            However, its complexity and dependence on data quality make it less attractive for
                            short-term traders. Combining
                            fundamental and technical analysis,
                            along with proper capital management, will help achieve success in trading.</p>
