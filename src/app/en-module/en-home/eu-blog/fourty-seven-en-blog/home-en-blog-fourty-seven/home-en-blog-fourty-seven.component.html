                                for long-term

                                <h2>What is Fundamental Analysis?</h2>
                                <p><strong>Fundamental analysis</strong> is a comprehensive approach that examines
                                    economic,
                                    financial,
                                    and political factors to understand the current state of the market and predict its
                                    future.
                                    It is applied in investments to evaluate the true value of an asset by comparing it
                                    with
                                    the market price.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Main Levels of Analysis</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Company Level:</strong> Analysis of financial statements, management
                                        structure, and competitive
                                        advantages.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Industry Level:</strong> Study of market conditions, trends, and
                                        competition
                                        levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Macroeconomic Level:</strong> Assessment of GDP, inflation rate,
                                        employment,
                                        and other economic
                                        indicators.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Global Factors:</strong> Influence of international policies, natural
                                        disasters, and other
                                        events.</li>

                                <h3>Fundamental Analysis in Trading</h3>
                                <p>Traders more frequently use fundamental analysis for long-term investments. For
                                    example,
                                    when trading stocks, this method helps identify companies with sustainable business
                                    models and strong growth
                                    prospects.
                                    However, for short-term trading, it is less effective due to its long-term nature.

                                <h2>Why is Fundamental Analysis Used Less Often?</h2>
                                <p>Despite its advantages, fundamental analysis is not as popular among traders,
                                    especially
                                    those trading
                                    short-term market fluctuations.
                                    The main reasons include:</p>

                                <h3>Major Players in the Market</h3>
                                <p>As Richard Wyckoff noted, major operators have significant resources and can predict
                                    market changes well in
                                    advance.
                                    They prepare for these changes ahead of time by leveraging privileged access to
                                    information unavailable to
                                    most market participants.</p>

                                <h3>Complexity of Analysis</h3>
                                <p>Fundamental analysis requires substantial time and knowledge. It involves analyzing
                                    vast
                                    amounts of data,
                                    ranging from corporate reports to geopolitical situations. Additionally, data may be
                                    distorted, increasing
                                    the risk of errors.</p>

                                <h3>The Role of Technical Analysis</h3>
                                <p><a class="linkrefinto"

                                        analysis</a>
                                    is more practical for traders as it allows them to react instantly to changes in
                                    prices
                                    and volumes.
                                    This is particularly important for those working with short-term strategies.</p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>Fundamental analysis is a valuable tool for long-term investors, helping them make
                                informed
                                decisions based on a
                                deep understanding of the market.
                                However, its complexity and dependence on data quality make it less attractive for
                                short-term traders. Combining
                                fundamental and technical analysis,
                                along with proper capital management, will help achieve success in trading.</p>
