                    </h1>


                    <p>Hello everyone! Today we will discuss the basics of market analysis using the Wyckoff method.
                        Many of you ask: "Why do we focus only
                        on technical analysis, not considering news, corporate reports, and other factors?" The answer
                        is simple: as retail
                        traders, we operate with information available through charts, without the privilege of
                        accessing primary data
                        available to big market players. Therefore, fundamental analysis is not as important for us.
                        This video is for those
                        interested in news and statistics.</p>
                    <p>Why don't we engage in fundamental analysis? Let's start with a small excerpt from Wyckoff's book
                        that will help us
                        understand this question:</p>
                    <p><i class="orange">"Large operators differ from small participants in their ability to
                            foresee significant
                            changes in stock prices six months or a year in advance and prepare for them. Studies of
                            these preparatory
                            periods show that understanding market anatomy, the direction of its future movement, and
                            possible magnitude are
                            key to successful trading. This study of turning points, growth, and panic is extremely
                            important. Small
                            participants must realize that the actions of those trading large volumes of securities
                            determine their profits.
                            Understanding market conditions helps develop such foresight. Knowledge of fundamental
                            aspects, such as
                            politics, company earnings, and others, often does not provide accurate forecasts. But this
                            does not mean that
                            beginners should ignore them. Understanding the positions of large operators is more
                            important than fundamental
                            data."</i></p>
                    <p>This excerpt explains that in the stock market, large players can anticipate future price
                        movements and prepare for
                        them in advance, using their resources and knowledge. They react to future asset values, while
                        small traders often
                        react to current events.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, our efforts are focused on technical analysis, which allows us to track changes in
                        prices and trading
                        volumes. We look for signals and patterns that help us make decisions about entering or exiting
                        positions. This
                        helps us minimize risks and improve our results.</p>
                    <p>If you have questions about how to choose stop-losses or manage your capital, refer to our <a
                            href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdXB70rGX5_zqH_X84Q_z0wj5pQYhdqfk&si=mDbXGvJUjxqsxBED"
                            class="orange dec">previous videos</a>, where we covered these topics in detail. We
                        recommend that beginners
                        first understand the basics of capital management because the right game conditions are
                        important for successful
                        trading.</p>
                    <p>Thus, fundamental factors are important, but for us, the key is understanding the technical
                        aspects of the market,
                        which help us make informed decisions.</p>
