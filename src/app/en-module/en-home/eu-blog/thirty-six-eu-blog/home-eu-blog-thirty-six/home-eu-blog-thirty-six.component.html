                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is <strong class="orange">Igor Arapov</strong> and today we'll talk about
                        cryptocurrency
                        trading. Using the example of the Bitcoin chart (<a
                            href="https://youtu.be/OETNN1j6KrU?si=GPiDx9DrP3JGRHA0"
                            class="orange dec">https://youtu.be/OETNN1j6KrU?si=GPiDx9DrP3JGRHA0</a>), I'll explain the
                        concept of <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> and liquidity capture. Where can you look
                        for entry points here and why?</p>
                    <p>To start with, let me remind you that the Smart Money concept involves searching for "smart
                        money". For newcomers not
                        familiar with cryptocurrencies, I'll briefly explain. In any market, there are professionals â€”
                        these are the large
                        players who buy low and sell high. The task of the retail trader is to see when they are active
                        in the market and to
                        buy or sell along with them. That is, you need to understand how the major market participants
                        act and follow them.
                    </p>
                    <p>On the Bitcoin chart, I've marked two levels. Today we'll discuss the false breakout. A false
                        breakout confirms that
                        there are large and smart money on the market. It is difficult for large capital to enter the
                        market with big money
                        due to limited liquidity. If they were to simply buy, the price would skyrocket. Therefore, they
                        resort to tricks.
                    </p>
                    <p>How does it work? They create a false breakout at a key level. They wait for sell orders or
                        stop-losses to accumulate
                        below the level from those who bought. The large capital sees these orders and sells on the
                        market to hook these
                        commands. The stop-losses are triggered, and the large capital forms its position on this
                        volume. Before the price
                        goes up, they try to throw other market participants out and gather the maximum liquidity at a
                        favorable price.</p>
                    <p>Understanding these processes gives us, retail traders, great opportunities. As long as the large
                        capital has not
                        bought, they can manipulate the market and hit stop-losses. Therefore, we do not buy until we
                        see the manipulation.
                        We wait for a false breakout and only then enter the market when we see that the large capital
                        is ready to rise.</p>
                    <p>The logic of a false breakout is simple: you get a good entry point with controllable risk. If
                        the price goes down,
                        you exit the trade and avoid losses. Buying at the lower edge of the level, you hold the
                        position until the upper
                        edge. The risk-reward ratio is greater than 1:1, and by repeating such trades, you will make a
                        profit.</p>
                    <p>Large capital does not always facilitate the trading of retail traders, throwing them out of the
                        market. But we need
                        to know this and use it in our trading.</p>
                    <p>I recommend studying the Smart Money concept and making successful deals.</p>
