                    </h1>


                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today we will talk about market imbalance. This is a
                        popular topic with
                        many videos about it. Imbalance is associated with trend reversal points and how a global
                        reversal occurs. The name
                        speaks for itself: there was balance, and then it was gone. If you want to catch trend
                        reversals, you need to learn
                        to see these moments on the chart.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Finding Balance on the Chart</h3>
                    <p>First, you need to find balance on the chart. This helps to understand how the market transitions
                        from a calm state
                        to an imbalance, that is, to a trend. You need to see a flat â€” this is when orders and volumes
                        are concentrated in
                        one range. It is important that one of the participants runs out in this range.</p>

                    <p>The basis of any bullish trend is a supply deficit. Smart participants buy on declines,
                        understanding the value. But
                        sooner or later, sellers run out in their range, and they have to raise the price to buy. This
                        is the logic of
                        imbalance: when volumes in the range are high, you can buy with limit orders without affecting
                        the price. But when
                        volumes run out, large buyers have to raise the price to get scarce liquidity. This leads to a
                        trend change.</p>

                    <p>Imbalance is usually a reversal pattern, and it is important to look for it at levels. At value
                        levels, the
                        accumulation phase occurs, after which the trend changes.</p>
