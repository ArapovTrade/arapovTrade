                  <h2>William Gann: Legend of Technical Analysis</h2>
                  <p>
                    <dfn>William Delbert Gann</dfn> entered history as one of
                    the most successful traders of the early twentieth century.
                    Born in 1878 in Texas, he dedicated his life to studying
                    financial market patterns and developed a unique analysis
                    system that remains relevant today.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Gann asserted that market movements follow mathematical and
                    geometric laws. To understand this topic more deeply, I
                    recommend studying the

                    >. Unlike contemporaries, he viewed markets as ordered
                    structures where price and time exist in specific
                    proportions. This approach enabled forecasting trend
                    reversals with high accuracy.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Gann's main legacy includes developing technical analysis
                    tools: lines, fan, grid, box, and the famous Square of 9.
                    Each method is based on the principle of price-time
                    interconnection.

                  <h2>Fundamental Principles of Gann Theory</h2>
                  <p>
                    Gann theory bases on the conviction that markets aren't
                    chaotic. <dfn>Price and time proportions</dfn> determine
                    movement direction, and understanding these relationships
                    opens opportunities for accurate forecasting.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The basic principle states: when price and time move in
                    equal proportions, markets remain in equilibrium. Deviation
                    from this balance signals potential reversal or trend
                    acceleration.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <dfn>Time cycles</dfn> constitute the most important
                    methodology element. Gann discovered that market events
                    repeat with certain periodicity. Studying historical
                    patterns helps predict future movements.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Crowd psychology was also considered in analysis. Gann
                    understood that market
                    <a
                      class="linkrefinto"

                    >
                    — fear and greed — create predictable price behavior
                    patterns.

                  <h2>Gann Line: Methodology Foundation</h2>
                  <p>
                    The <dfn>Gann Line</dfn> represents a trend line at 45
                    degrees, designated as 1x1. This angle symbolizes ideal
                    equilibrium: one unit of price change corresponds to one
                    unit of time change.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When price positions above the 1x1 line, markets demonstrate
                    uptrend strength. Positioning below indicates seller
                    dominance. Line crossing often signals market sentiment
                    change.
                  </p>

                    loading="lazy"
                  />

                  <p>
                    Practical application requires drawing lines from
                    significant lows or highs. Traders use them for determining
                    entry points, placing stop-losses, and taking profits.

                  <h2>Gann Fan: Multiple Levels</h2>
                  <p>
                    The <dfn>Gann Fan</dfn> extends the single line concept,
                    adding trend line sets at various angles. Typical fans
                    include angles 1x1, 2x1, 1x2, 3x1, 1x3, 4x1, 1x4, and 8x1,
                    1x8.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Each fan line serves as potential support or resistance
                    level. Steeper angles (2x1, 3x1) reflect strong trends,
                    gentler ones (1x2, 1x3) indicate weak or corrective
                    movements.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    When one fan line breaks, price typically heads toward the
                    next. This property makes the tool useful for determining
                    movement targets and potential reversal zones.
                  </p>

                  <h2>Gann Grid and Box</h2>
                  <p>
                    The <dfn>Gann Grid</dfn> overlays uniform structure on
                    charts, dividing space into squares by price and time. Grid
                    line intersections indicate potential reversal zones.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The tool proves especially effective for identifying price
                    movement symmetry. If previous impulses took certain time
                    units, subsequent ones may prove proportional.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The <dfn>Gann Box</dfn> represents rectangular areas bounded
                    by significant extremes. Box boundaries work as support and
                    resistance levels, while dimensions indicate potential
                    amplitude of subsequent movements.

                  <h2>Square of 9: Advanced Tool</h2>
                  <p>
                    The <dfn>Square of 9</dfn> is considered Gann's most complex
                    and mystical tool. This numerical matrix arranges values
                    spiraling from center to periphery.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The main principle involves finding price levels positioned
                    at specific square angles. Numbers on single diagonals or
                    cardinal axes often coincide with actual market reversal
                    levels.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Applying Square of 9 requires deep understanding of
                    mathematical patterns. Experienced traders use it for
                    determining movement targets and entry points with high
                    success probability.

                  <h2>Gann's Trading Rules</h2>
                  <p>
                    Beyond technical tools, Gann formulated successful trading
                    principles based on discipline and

                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Strict adherence to

                    protects against emotional decisions. Strategy changes under
                    fear or greed influence lead to chaotic actions and losses.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Limiting risk per trade to 2-5% of deposit ensures survival
                    through failure series. Gann emphasized that capital
                    preservation matters more than multiplication.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Partial profit-taking helps avoid losing accumulated income.
                    Greed forcing position holding until the end often leads to
                    market reversals against traders.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Continuous learning and adaptation to changing market
                    conditions distinguish professionals from amateurs. Gann
                    himself continuously improved methods throughout his career.

                <section>
                  <h2>Practical Application of Gann Methods</h2>
                  <p>
                    Effective Gann tool usage requires comprehensive approaches.
                    Isolated single method application yields less reliable
                    signals than combining several.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Begin by identifying significant extremes on charts. These
                    points become foundations for building lines, fans, and
                    grids. Use multiple timeframes for signal confirmation.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Combine Gann tools with classical technical analysis.
                    Fibonacci levels, candlestick patterns, and volume
                    indicators strengthen forecast accuracy.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Maintain trade journals recording each tool application
                    results. Statistics reveal which methods work better for
                    specific markets and trading styles.

                </section>

                <section>
                  <h2>Relevance of Gann Methods Today</h2>
                  <p>
                    Despite algorithmic trading development and new indicator
                    emergence, Gann principles retain practical value.
                    Fundamental price-time relationships haven't changed over
                    the century.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Modern trading platforms include Gann tools in standard
                    sets. This demonstrates professional community recognition
                    of their effectiveness.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Gann methodology disciplines traders, requiring systematic
                    analysis instead of impulsive decisions. This aspect proves
                    especially valuable in eras of information noise and high
                    volatility.

                  <h2>Advantages and Limitations of Gann Methods</h2>
                  <p>
                    Gann tools offer unique combinations of price and time
                    analysis. This comprehensive approach distinguishes them
                    from classical technical analysis indicators working only
                    with price.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The main advantage lies in ability to determine not only
                    reversal levels but also timing of their occurrence. This
                    gives traders opportunities to plan trades in advance.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The geometric nature of tools ensures analysis objectivity.
                    Angles and proportions don't depend on subjective
                    interpretation, unlike many chart patterns.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    However, Gann methods require significant time to master.
                    Calculation complexity, especially for Square of 9,
                    discourages beginners. Effective application comes with
                    experience and practice.

                  <h2>Integration with Modern Analysis Methods</h2>
                  <p>
                    Gann tools demonstrate greatest effectiveness combined with
                    other methods. Fibonacci levels often coincide with Gann
                    lines, strengthening significance of certain zones.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Volume analysis confirms or refutes signals generated by
                    geometric tools. Volume increase as price approaches Gann
                    lines raises reaction probability.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Candlestick patterns help determine entry moments. When
                    reversal formations appear on fan lines, signals are
                    considered more reliable.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Momentum indicators add information about current movement
                    strength. Divergence near Gann levels warns of possible
                    trend reversals.

                  <h2>Recommendations for Learning Gann Methodology</h2>
                  <p>
                    Begin mastering with the simplest tool — the 1x1 line. Build
                    it on several charts and observe price reactions. Practice
                    on historical data forms intuitive understanding.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Gradually add the Gann fan, experimenting with various
                    angles. Notice which lines work more often on chosen
                    instruments and timeframes.
                  </p>

                  <p>

                        William Delbert Gann (1878-1955) was a legendary
                        American trader and analyst who developed a unique
                        market forecasting system based on mathematics,
                        geometry, and time cycles. His methods are still used by
                        traders worldwide.

                      <p>
                        The Gann 1x1 line is a trend line at a 45° angle that
                        symbolizes equilibrium between price and time. If price
                        is above the line, the trend is bullish; below it,
                        bearish. This is the fundamental tool in Gann
                        methodology.

                          How does the Gann fan work?</mat-panel-title

                      <p>
                        The Gann fan is a set of lines at different angles (1x1,
                        2x1, 1x2, etc.) drawn from a single point. Lines serve
                        as dynamic support and resistance levels. When one line
                        breaks, price typically moves toward the next.

                      <p>
                        Square of 9 is a numerical matrix where numbers are
                        arranged in a spiral. It's used to determine key price
                        levels and reversal points. Considered one of the most
                        complex but accurate Gann tools.

                      <p>
                        Yes, Gann methods remain relevant. They're based on
                        fundamental principles of price-time relationships that
                        haven't changed. Many professional traders use Gann
                        tools combined with modern analysis methods.
