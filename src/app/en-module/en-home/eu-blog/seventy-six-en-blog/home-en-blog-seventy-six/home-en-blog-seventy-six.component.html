                                <p>William Delbert Gann was a legendary trader whose market forecasting methods still
                                    attract interest from
                                    analysts, investors, and speculators. Born in 1878 in Texas, he began his career in
                                    the stock market at
                                    the beginning of the 20th century. He went down in history as one of the most
                                    successful traders,
                                    developing a unique price analysis system based on <strong>mathematical patterns,
                                        geometry,
                                        astrology, psychology, and time cycles</strong>.</p>

                                <p>Gann argued that the market follows clear mathematical and geometric principles that
                                    can be studied and used to predict future price movements. Unlike other traders of
                                    his time, he
                                    believed that it was essential to consider not only technical analysis but also
                                    behavioral
                                    factors influencing
                                    market movements.</p>

                                <h3>Key Achievements of Gann:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Development of market cycle theory.</strong> Gann studied recurring
                                        price movements and
                                        developed forecasting methods based on time patterns.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Creation of unique technical analysis tools.</strong> Among them are
                                        <strong>Gann
                                            Lines, Gann Fan, Gann Box, Gann Grid, and Square of 9</strong>, which are
                                        still
                                        used in trading.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>High accuracy in forecasts.</strong> His analytical methods allowed him
                                        to predict
                                        trend reversals and key support and resistance levels with high probability.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Publication of educational materials.</strong> Gann wrote several
                                        books, including <em>“How to Make Profits in Commodities”</em> and <em>“New
                                            Stock Trend
                                            Detector”</em>,
                                        where he explained his trading principles.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fundamental approach to trading psychology.</strong> He was one of
                                        the first to recognize the impact of emotions, discipline,
                                        and self-control on trading success.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>William Gann is remembered as one of the few traders whose methods remain relevant
                                    today. His
                                    approach to trading combines technical analysis, mathematics,
                                    time cycles, and psychology,
                                    making his system one of the most comprehensive in the financial markets.</p>

                                <p>Despite criticism from some analysts, Gann proved in practice that
                                    his methods could be profitable.
                                    He did not just trade but studied market patterns, predicted
                                    trends, and developed
                                    unique
                                    analytical tools. His legacy continues to inspire traders and researchers
                                    seeking to uncover the secrets of market movements.</p>

                                <h2>Key Principles of Gann’s Theory</h2>
                                <p>William Gann was convinced that the market is not a chaotic structure but follows
                                    the laws of mathematics,
                                    geometry, and time cycles. He believed that price movements could be
                                    predicted if one correctly
                                    analyzes
                                    the proportions of time and asset value. His theory is based on the idea that price,
                                    time, and volume are interconnected,
                                    and their patterns can be used to forecast future market movements.
                                </p>

                                <p>Gann studied market behavior cycles and identified recurring patterns that
                                    help determine
                                    reversal points, support, and resistance levels. His approach to
                                    trading remains relevant today
                                    because it is based on fundamental data analysis principles.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Key Principles of Gann’s Theory:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Proportions of price and time.</strong> Gann stated that there is a
                                        direct
                                        correlation between price movements and time intervals.
                                        If time and price move in equal proportions,
                                        the market remains balanced.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Key angles.</strong> He developed a system of angles (such as the 45°
                                        angle
                                        or 1x1), which helps
                                        determine trend direction and key support and resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Numerical sequences.</strong> Gann used mathematical proportions such as
                                        1/8, 1/4,
                                        1/2,
                                        to predict reversal zones and identify important price levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Crowd psychology.</strong> He believed that market behavior is shaped
                                        not only by technical factors
                                        but also by traders' emotions. Panic and euphoria can cause sharp price
                                        movements,
                                        which should be considered
                                        in a trading strategy.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Event cycles.</strong> Gann analyzed recurring
                                        historical patterns and used them
                                        to
                                        predict future movements. He believed that history repeats itself in the market
                                        due to traders’ consistent behavioral patterns.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Market geometry.</strong> Gann applied geometric constructions
                                        (grids, squares, fans) to
                                        identify symmetrical price movements and determine entry and exit points.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Practical Application of Gann’s Theory</h3>
                                <p>Traders who use Gann’s methods apply his principles for:</p>
                                <ul>

                                            and resistance levels</a> based on Gann’s angles.</li>
                                    <li>Forecasting market cycles considering time-based patterns.</li>
                                    <li>Identifying entry and exit points using numerical sequences.</li>
                                    <li>Analyzing market participants’ behavior and the influence of crowd psychology.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Gann’s methodology remains an essential tool for traders seeking not
                                    just to react to the market
                                    but to understand its fundamental patterns. His theory is applied in various
                                    trading styles, from
                                    scalping
                                    to long-term investing.</p>

                                    Gann’s analysis method. He believed that this angle <strong>symbolizes the balance

                                    above the 1x1 line, the trend remains bullish, and if below, it is bearish.

                                <h2>William Gann’s Rules for Successful Trading</h2>
                                <p>In addition to his unique market forecasting methods, William Gann developed a list
                                    of key trading
                                    rules
                                    that help traders avoid mistakes, minimize risks, and
                                    improve trading profitability.
                                    These principles
                                    are based not only on mathematical calculations and <a class="linkrefinto"

                                    but also on
                                    <a class="linkrefinto"

                                    discipline, and capital management.
                                </p>

                                <p>Gann believed that a successful trader must not only understand market patterns but
                                    also control
                                    their emotions,
                                    stick to a strategy, and manage risks. His “golden” rules
                                    remain relevant today,
                                    helping traders
                                    of all levels avoid common mistakes.</p>

                                <h3>Key Trading Rules by Gann:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Follow your trading plan.</strong> Changing strategy based on emotions
                                        leads to chaotic decisions and
                                        losses.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Always use <a class="linkrefinto"
                                                href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/stoploss">stop-losses</a>.</strong>
                                        This is one of
                                        the main tools
                                        for protecting capital from significant
                                        losses.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Do not risk more than 2-5% of your deposit on a single trade.</strong>
                                        Gann
                                        emphasized that proper risk
                                        management is the key to long-term success.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Analyze market cycles.</strong> History repeats itself, and
                                        understanding
                                        past movements can help
                                        predict the future.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Take profits in parts.</strong> Greed prevents traders from closing
                                        trades
                                        on time, so
                                        it is better to secure profits gradually.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Limit the number of trades.</strong> The more a trader trades without
                                        a clear strategy, the higher
                                        the likelihood of losses. Quality is always more important than quantity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Control your emotions.</strong> Trading under stress, fear, or
                                        euphoria leads to
                                        impulsive decisions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Avoid <a class="linkrefinto"
                                                href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/forexleveragerisk">excessive
                                                leverage</a>.</strong>
                                        Using high leverage increases profits,
                                        but also greatly increases risk.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Always learn and adapt.</strong> The market is constantly changing,
                                        so it is essential to stay updated with new
                                        trends and improve your skills.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>How to Apply Gann’s Rules in Modern Trading?</h3>
                                <p>These rules can be effectively applied to any trading strategy. To do this,
                                    it is important to:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Develop a clear trading plan and follow it.</li>
                                    <li>Determine an acceptable risk level and strictly adhere to it.</li>
                                    <li>Focus on long-term capital growth rather than quick speculation.</li>
                                    <li>Analyze mistakes and keep a trading journal to improve
                                        strategy.</li>
                                    <li>Study historical data and market cycles to identify patterns.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Gann proved that success in trading is not a matter of luck but a result of
                                    discipline, a systematic approach, and
                                    sound capital management.
                                    By following his “golden” rules, traders can minimize mistakes and achieve
                                    consistent results.
