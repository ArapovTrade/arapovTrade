                    </h1>


                    <p>Hello! I am Igor Arapov and today we will discuss an important topic: when is the best time to
                        trade on the market.
                        Many beginner traders think that you can trade at any time since the market is always open. But
                        in reality, timing
                        is very important.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Active Sessions</h3>
                    <p>First of all, I would like to note that the European and American sessions are the most active
                        trading hours. It is
                        during this time, when the European and American sessions overlap, that banks process the
                        maximum number of client
                        orders, leading to huge trading volumes. This is a very busy time, a time of large volumes.</p>

                    <p>If you study volume market analysis, you have probably noticed that it is during these hours that
                        some of the largest
                        volumes enter the market. This is not surprising, as it is during this time that there is the
                        highest activity of
                        traders.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Key News</h3>
                    <p>It is also worth mentioning that key news often comes out before the start of the American
                        session. For example, news
                        can be released at 15:30 when America is just waking up. Therefore, it is important for beginner
                        traders to consider
                        the trading hours.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Less Active Hours</h3>
                    <p>Asia and the Pacific region are less active hours. Trading volumes at this time are minimal, and
                        there is no point in
                        sitting in front of the monitor around the clock. This is the first plus.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">False Breakouts</h3>
                    <p>The second plus is that false breakouts on the market often occur at the beginning of the
                        European session. Before
                        the session starts, market makers can make false moves to confuse traders. This is a good time
                        to trade in the
                        opposite direction.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Start of the American Session</h3>
                    <p>The start of the American session is also an important moment. If the European session has been
                        calm, the American
                        session is often active and trending. Sometimes Europe stands still, which may indicate a trend
                        is forming for the
                        American session.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Thus, dividing time into time zones in trading is very useful, and many experienced traders do
                        this.</p>
