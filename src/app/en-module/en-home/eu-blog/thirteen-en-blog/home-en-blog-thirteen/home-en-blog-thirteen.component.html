                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov. Today we will talk about Elliott Waves and Fibonacci
                        Levels. I have been
                        trading for over 11 years and want to share my experience with these tools.</p>

                    <p>This is not a critique of Elliott Waves and Fibonacci Levels. They are popular, and many traders
                        use them. I am
                        simply sharing my opinion, and perhaps it will help beginner traders understand whether these
                        tools are necessary
                        for them.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Elliott Waves</h3>
                    <p>Let's start with Elliott Waves. According to Elliott's theory, the market moves in waves. There
                        are five waves in the
                        direction of the trend and three against the trend. The stock market is a place where everyone
                        wants to make money,
                        but the market is unpredictable. Technical analysis tries to find patterns to predict market
                        movements.</p>

                    <p>Elliott Waves attempt to systematize the market through impulsive and corrective waves. Each wave
                        has sub-waves,
                        creating a fractal nature of the market. The problem is that this is subjective. Two traders can
                        draw the waves
                        differently on the same chart.</p>

                    <p>It is difficult to build a trading system on subjective factors. A trading system should be
                        objective and logical.
                        Therefore, although the concept of Elliott Waves is popular, I have not found practical
                        application for it in 11
                        years.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Fibonacci Levels</h3>
                    <p>Now about Fibonacci Levels. We use Fibonacci numbers to understand where a correction will end
                        and join the impulse.
                        Fibonacci numbers exist in nature, but the market is not nature. It reflects human behavior,
                        which is not always
                        subject to mathematical calculations.</p>

                    <p>Levels work because they show the decisions of market participants, while waves and Fibonacci
                        numbers are an attempt
                        to impose one's opinion on the market. I have seen many traders who successfully trade levels,
                        and very few who
                        successfully use Elliott Waves or Fibonacci Levels.</p>

                    <p>I hope my thoughts were helpful. Remember, my experience is subjective. If you have successful
                        experience using these
                        tools, share it in the comments.</p>
