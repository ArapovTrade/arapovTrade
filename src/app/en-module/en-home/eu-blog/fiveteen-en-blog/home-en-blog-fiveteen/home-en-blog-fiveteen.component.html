                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello, friends! My name is Igor Arapov and today I will tell you about futures.</p>

                    <p>Futures are an important part of trading, and anyone who wants to trade needs to know what they
                        are and how they
                        work. This will help save money when trading. A future is a contract that obliges you to fulfill
                        the conditions. I
                        want to emphasize the word "obliges". This is a contract that obliges you on the exchange.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">What are Futures?</h3>
                    <p>Futures appeared as a way to fix the price for the seller, for example, so that a farmer could
                        fix the price of wheat
                        in advance. With the development of the market, settlement futures appeared, which do not imply
                        the delivery of
                        goods. It's a game for money: you earn if the price goes in your direction, and you lose if it
                        goes against you.</p>

                    <p>Futures are a risky instrument due to high volatility. Especially in cryptocurrency markets,
                        where there is a lot of
                        speculative money. This money comes to the market and is redistributed.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Obligations in Futures Contracts</h3>
                    <p>A futures contract obliges you to perform certain actions. For example, if you bought bitcoin at
                        71,000 and the price
                        fell to 50,000, you would lose 28%. This happens due to the work of market makers who provide
                        liquidity in the
                        market. If the price goes down, they can remove support, and you will lose money.</p>

                    <p>In the spot market (e.g., buying stocks), no one forces you to sell. You can hold them for a long
                        time. But in
                        futures, the market can collapse, and you will lose money.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Risks and Benefits</h3>
                    <p>When you sell a future, you are obliged to return it at a higher price if the price rises. This
                        benefits market
                        makers who make money on your losses. This is a brutal business, and it needs to be understood
                        to avoid losing
                        money.</p>

                    <p>I hope this information was helpful, especially for beginners. Volume market analysis helps to
                        see the trades of
                        major participants and understand how they affect prices. I recommend getting acquainted with
                        volume analysis and
                        the Smart Money concept to avoid falling into professional traps.</p>
