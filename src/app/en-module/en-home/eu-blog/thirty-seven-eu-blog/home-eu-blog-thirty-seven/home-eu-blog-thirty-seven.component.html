                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! Today we will discuss an important topic â€” <strong class="orange">market
                            drawdowns</strong>. For many beginners,
                        setting a <strong class="orange">stop-loss</strong> becomes a problem due to uncertainty about
                        where to properly
                        place it, which often leads to ignoring this tool. As a result, the market can move against them
                        so strongly that
                        losses grow and the account begins to decrease rapidly. Today we will understand how to avoid
                        such situations, what
                        rules should be followed to minimize drawdowns, and how to properly use averaging positions to
                        get out of them.</p>
                    <p>Let's start with the basics. A drawdown occurs when a trader does not consider the current market
                        trend. For example,
                        if we look at the NASDAQ index, it is obviously growing. Simple technical analysis shows an
                        increase in lows, which
                        indicates a strong growth perspective. If you open selling positions or enter the market at
                        lows, it may later turn
                        out that the market has moved up significantly and it will be difficult to correct the mistake.
                    </p>
                    <p>Therefore, the following rule is important: never trade against the current trend. Trending
                        markets usually move in
                        one direction for a long time. If you get stuck in such a market, you will have to wait a long
                        time, which can
                        negatively affect your psychological state and your balance. You will have to constantly add
                        money to the account to
                        survive in such a situation. Even when the market begins to change, traders who ignore the
                        current trend often do
                        not notice it in time.</p>
                    <p>The problem is that traders often work against the market. For example, when prices are rising,
                        they sell, and when
                        prices are falling, they buy. It is very important to understand that these transactions often
                        turn out to be
                        unprofitable because there is no support from levels that can be used for averaging. The market
                        often moves far, not
                        giving traders in the current trend a chance to fix the profit.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, attempts to catch a trend reversal are often ineffective and costly. My
                        recommendation: always check
                        whether you are trading against the current trend. If the market signals the start of a new
                        trend (for example,
                        through technical analysis), it is better to close the current positions. After the market
                        confirms the change of
                        trend, you can think about the possibility of averaging positions, but always in the direction
                        of the current trend.
                        Statistics show that this helps to avoid significant losses.</p>
                    <p>That's all for today. I hope this information will be useful for those who are just starting
                        their journey in
                        trading. Successful trades to everyone!</p>
