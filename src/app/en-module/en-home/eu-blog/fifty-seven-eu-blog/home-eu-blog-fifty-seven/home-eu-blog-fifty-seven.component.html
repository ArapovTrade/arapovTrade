                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello, friends! My name is Igor Arapov, and today I want to talk about <strong
                            class="orange">indicators</strong> in trading. I have
                        been trading for over 11 years, and I want to share my experience and advice on using indicators
                        in trading.</p>

                    <p>Most of us enter trading through <strong class="orange">indicators</strong>. It's a popular topic
                        in trading books.
                        There are many different indicators, and beginner traders often take them at face value. But
                        with time and
                        experience, many begin to doubt their effectiveness. I went through this too, and during my
                        first three years, I
                        actively used various indicators until I abandoned them, except for the <strong
                            class="orange">volume</strong>
                        indicator. Those who watch my videos know that apart from <strong
                            class="orange">volume</strong>, I don't use
                        anything else for forecasting.</p>

                    <p>Why did I abandon indicators? Let's break it down.</p>

                    <p>There are two types of indicators: <strong class="orange">oscillators</strong>, which catch
                        market reversals, and
                        <strong class="orange">trend indicators</strong>, which predict the trend direction. The market
                        has two key states:
                        flat (reversals up and down) and trend (directional movement). The problem is that <strong
                            class="orange">indicators</strong> lag behind. To get a signal from an indicator, you need
                        to wait for the bar
                        to form, and you don't know what it will be. So, you're always chasing the market.
                    </p>

                    <p>For example, a <strong class="orange">trend indicator</strong> like the moving average sometimes
                        captures good
                        trends. When the price falls, and the indicator shows downward movement, you can stay in a
                        profitable position for a
                        long time. But an <strong class="orange">oscillator</strong> like the stochastic might show
                        overbought or oversold
                        conditions, leading to opposite signals. The question arises: which one to trust â€” the moving
                        average or the
                        stochastic? If one indicator shows profit and the other loss, it raises doubts about their use.
                        Sometimes they work,
                        sometimes they don't.</p>

                    <p>There are many indicators that try to analyze the market comprehensively, but they also lag. An
                        example might be the
                        volatility indicator ATR (Average True Range), which shows how volatile the market is compared
                        to previous days.
                        It's useful for locking in profits but not for predicting price movement.</p>

                    <p><strong class="orange">Volumes</strong>, on the other hand, allow you to understand the
                        intentions of market
                        participants. By looking at <strong class="orange">volumes</strong>, we can see how much was
                        bought or sold and
                        identify the presence of large players. This helps predict future price movements based on
                        current supply and
                        demand. In this regard, <strong class="orange">volumes</strong> outperform any indicator because
                        they allow you to
                        look into the future rather than analyze the past.</p>

                    <p>After many years of experimentation, I concluded that it's best to use <strong
                            class="orange">volumes</strong> when
                        analyzing the market. I advise beginner traders to continue experimenting with <strong
                            class="orange">indicators</strong> to gain experience. But remember, indicators focused on
                        tracking price will
                        always lag. It's better to use tools that help predict future price movements, such as <strong
                            class="orange">volumes</strong>.</p>
