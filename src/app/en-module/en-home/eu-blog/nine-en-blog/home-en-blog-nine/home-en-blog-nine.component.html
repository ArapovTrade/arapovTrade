                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today we will talk about how to forecast market
                        prices. In previous
                        articles, I mentioned that beginner traders need to learn to see bounces from levels or
                        breakouts. Now I will delve
                        deeper into this topic and discuss what beginners are often interested in. Unfortunately, many
                        of them get confused
                        with their goals and therefore do not achieve success.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">What do I mean?</h3>
                    <p>When we draw levels on the chart, we see where the market considers the price to be cheap or
                        expensive. At cheap
                        levels, we look for entry points for buying. How exactly to find these points — by volumes or
                        candlestick patterns —
                        is a secondary question. The main thing is to understand that the market is telling us that the
                        price does not want
                        to go lower. We interpret this information and buy, placing a stop-loss. This is not related to
                        price forecasting.
                    </p>

                    <p>When large funds and banks forecast a company's profit, they do not use indicators like
                        stochastic or MACD.
                        Therefore, beginner traders hoping to find a tool that will tell them what the market will do in
                        a day or two fall
                        into a trap. Forecasting future trends is a complex task that requires a large amount of
                        information and experience.
                    </p>

                    <p>Those who try to forecast prices using indicators are essentially looking at the past. But why do
                        you need indicators
                        when you can simply identify levels, see where it is expensive, where it is cheap, and trade
                        between these levels?
                        Intraday traders simply listen to the market and act accordingly. This does not guarantee 100%
                        success, but it
                        increases the likelihood of a positive outcome. Over time, you will be in profit if you follow
                        the risk-reward
                        ratio.</p>

                    <p>All trading comes down to monotonous activity — buying at a level and selling at a level.
                        Attempting to forecast the
                        market is unrealistic; it is impossible. On my YouTube channel (<a
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArapovTrade">www.youtube.com/&#64;ArapovTrade</a>), I record
                        weekly market reviews,
                        discuss news and factors affecting the market, mark levels, and try to forecast fundamental
                        things such as the Fed's
                        monetary policy. But any event can change the forecast.</p>

                    <p>A trader should not clutter their mind with forecasts. They open the chart, look at the levels,
                        and act. If you
                        explain your role in the market correctly, there will be no problems: buy where it is cheap,
                        sell where it is
                        expensive. Trying to forecast the price a few days ahead will lead to problems. This is too
                        complex a task. It is
                        better to trade from level to level — anyone can do this.</p>

                    <p>Start with simple things, as I recommend in the "Quick Start". Grow gradually, having a solid
                        foundation, but do not
                        rely on indicators for market forecasting. Start with levels, and you won't need to engage in
                        forecasting.</p>
