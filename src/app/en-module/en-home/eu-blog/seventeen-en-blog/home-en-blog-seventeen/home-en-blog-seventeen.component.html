                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello, friends! My name is Igor Arapov and today we will talk about myths in trading.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Myth One — High Profitability</h3>
                    <p>Many beginners start with cryptocurrencies, thinking they will get rich quickly. When Bitcoin is
                        rising, it seems
                        easy. But the cryptocurrency market is young and unstable. Experienced traders earn from 2 to 5%
                        per month, and 5%
                        is a very good result. All stories about 100%, 200%, and higher profitability are myths. Yes,
                        sometimes you can make
                        a lucky investment and earn, but stable income is more important. It's better to have small but
                        consistent earnings
                        than a one-time big win. Participants who are prone to adventure try to guess which coin will
                        shoot up to cover
                        losses from all the others, but this is not classic trading.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Myth Two — Trading is Difficult</h3>
                    <p>Trading is not so much difficult as it requires self-control. It's similar to gambling, and many
                        lose money due to
                        greed and the desire to make quick profits. The main difficulty is controlling your emotions.
                        Trading is specific
                        but not as difficult as higher mathematics. Some beginners think that they will watch a few
                        videos and immediately
                        become pros. This is a mistaken belief. To be a successful trader, you need to know the right
                        things and stick to a
                        system.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Myth Three — Trading is Confused with Investing</h3>
                    <p>Investing is owning an asset that generates profit. Trading is not investing. When you buy coins,
                        you are trying to
                        guess their growth, not investing. Real investments are not related to speculation.</p>

                    <p>If you buy a factory, it should work for you, and you should only be concerned about the size of
                        the dividend yield,
                        not the market value of your factory.</p>
