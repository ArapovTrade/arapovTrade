                  Below are charts with entry point examples. What you see here
                  is not
                  <strong>something unique</strong>, but a simple consequence of
                  trading theory, which is published on the website and grouped
                  by key topics. The purpose of these charts is to demonstrate
                  the practical application of theory and provide beginner

                  At the end of the examples, I have attached a statement from
                  one of my students who passed the practical exam after
                  completing my training and no longer trades on a "demo
                  account" but has moved to a real trading account. This
                  statistic will help beginner traders understand concepts such
                  as <strong>WinRate</strong> of a trading system and examine
                  the probability distribution of trades. Additionally, the
                  presented statement will visually illustrate why

                  On the 4-hour chart, we will analyze a classic example of
                  working with levels. I specifically chose Nasdaq because, at

                    <strong>Bearish Engulfing</strong> pattern, which indicates
                    that bears are in control and ready to sell aggressively. A
                    break below the low of the
                    <strong>false breakout</strong> bar signals the start of a
                    trend in the opposite direction.

                  <strong>Note</strong>: It is essential to understand that a
                  trade and the reasons behind entering it are a combination of
                  factors in

                  that we consider before opening a position. Key factors such
                  as support and resistance levels, pin bars, false breakouts,
                  and Price Action patterns make sense when used together rather
                  than in isolation.

                  It is also crucial to consider another condition that is
                  essential for any trade - money management. A trader must
                  understand that even when following all the conditions, there
                  is no guarantee that the market will move in their favor.
                  Therefore, they must not only manage risk in each individual
                  trade but also transfer it across trades to maintain a
                  consistent profit over the long run.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>The key condition for achieving profitability</strong>
                  over multiple trades is that for every $1 of risk, you should
                  aim for a minimum of $3 in potential profit. This means that
                  the distance to the target (where the trade is closed) in
                  points should be three times greater than the distance to the
                  stop-loss order, which limits risk in the trade.

                    Key moment of the level - a false breakout. As in the
                    previous example, we want to see an attempt to push the
                    price up without success. Below the volume bars, we can see
                    a surge in trading activity, which shows how buyers are

                    have already discussed that, locally, large capital can
                    manipulate prices (if the market allows it) to attract
                    participants. At the same time, stop-losses are triggered,
                    and breakout orders placed beyond the conditional
                    <strong>resistance</strong> level are executed. All this
                    facilitates the liquidation of previously opened long

                    Mark the low of the potential
                    <strong>false breakout</strong> bar, and when the price
                    moves below this low, a sell order is executed. Following
                    classic Price Action - <strong>bearish engulfing</strong>.

                    Setting a mandatory protective
                    <strong>stop-loss</strong> order, as there is a chance that
                    the breakout might not be <strong>false</strong>. Therefore,
                    it is necessary to protect the deposit from risks. By
                    classic rules, the price should not go above the bar we
                    consider <strong>false</strong>, so the stop-loss is placed
                    just above its peak + a few pips for the broker's or

                    The target for the trade is the opposite level, where buyers
                    previously took control of the market.

                  As always, we consider the ideal 3:1 scenario, where for every
                  dollar of risk, the potential profit should be at least 3
                  dollars. If this ratio is not met, then there is no trade.

                    fails. In this example, the pin bar is not as clearly
                    visible as on other time frames, but this does not change
                    its significance, as you will always see empty waves without
                    volume spikes (low interest in market growth), after which
                    the market starts to decline.

                    A false breakout is the key attribute of our increased
                    attention. As always, the same characteristics: high volume,
                    an attempt to rise above the pin bar or a low-volume wave,
                    and as a result, the price starts to decline.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We highlight the low of the
                    <strong>potential false breakout</strong> bar and enter the
                    trade when <strong>bearish engulfing</strong> occurs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We set a stop-loss (protective order) to control risks in
                    the trade.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    We determine the target as the opposite level from which the

                    A false breakout of the level, an attempt to lift the market

                    usually happens on increased volumes), stop-loss orders of
                    short-sellers are also triggered, and breakout orders are
                    opened for those participants waiting for a level breakout
                    (opening long trades). All these orders collectively create
                    significant demand (<strong>liquidity</strong> ), which is
                    used by <strong>Smart Money</strong> to open their
                    speculative short positions or simply to lock in profits
                    from existing long positions, which also constitutes

                    As usual, according to the rules of

                    " pattern, which will indicate the dominance of bears ready
                    to aggressively sell at the market. A breakout of the low of
                    the false breakout bar will signal the start of a trend in

                    In this example, we do not have an impulse level from a higher TF,

                  <li>
                    In the range, we wait for the "<strong>Pin Bar</strong>" pattern as an attempt to rise
                    that breaks down. This indicates the inability of buyers
                    to push the price above level "1." Typically, this happens on low

                    <strong>False breakout</strong> - the main attribute of our heightened attention.
                    As always, the same characteristics: increased volume,
                    an attempt to rise above the pin bar or wave without volume,
                    and as a result, the price starts to decline. This again shows
                    the inability to produce higher prices (now only with

                    when a bearish engulfing pattern occurs, following all the rules of

                  Example of a practical trading session by one of my students,
                  using a demo account (until the exam is passed, I do not
                  recommend using real funds).
                </p>
                <br />

                </div>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The goal of this exam is to complete at least 40 trades
                  following the rules of the trading system we study in lessons
                  and assess the results of these trades.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A demo account is opened with any broker or exchange, after
                  which trading begins with the minimum lot by default. The goal
                  of this exam is not to show absolute profit but to evaluate
                  the probability distribution of trades in the trading system.
                </p>

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    The first important metric is the win rate of the system,
                    which you can see in the Profit Trades (63.27%) and Loss
                    Trades (36.73%) columns. This metric represents the
                    probability distribution of the trading system. In simple
                    terms, out of 100 trades, an average of 63 will be
                    profitable, and 37 will be losing trades (classic
                    level-based trading).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The second metric is the Profit Factor, which shows how much
                    profit is generated for every dollar of loss. In this
                    example, it is approximately 2.5. The higher this metric,
                    the more profitable the trading system is. The minimum
                    acceptable level, in my opinion, is 1.8-2, considering all
                    commissions. With such a ratio, the deposit is likely to
                    grow over time.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The third metric is Maximal DrawDown. This indicates
                    <strong>account drawdown</strong> as the ratio of free funds
                    to the total balance. In this case, the drawdown is near
                    zero because the trading system enforces the use of stop
                    losses and prevents <strong>deep drawdowns</strong>.
                  </li>
                </ul>

                  <strong>Conclusion</strong>: The information provided on the
                  website in the form of articles and video tutorials is
                  sufficient for a solid introduction to trading. Anyone can
