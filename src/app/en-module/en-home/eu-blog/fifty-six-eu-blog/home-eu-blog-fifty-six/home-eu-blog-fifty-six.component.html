                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello, friends! My name is Igor Arapov, and today I want to talk about trading books.</p>

                    <p>I know that many people learn trading on their own, but of course, we need to mention <strong
                            class="orange">trading
                            books</strong>, as they are also important for self-education. Videos can be more specific,
                        of course, but books
                        are also useful, especially from the perspective of psychological support.</p>

                    <p>For example, when you read good trading books like <strong class="orange">"Long-Term
                            Secrets"</strong> by Larry
                        Williams, you feel that you are not alone. Larry Williams is a legend in trading, and his book
                        shows how he overcame
                        difficulties, lost money, but didn't give up and achieved success. This is inspiring.</p>

                    <p>I have always emphasized that the main advantage of paid education is the support of the teacher.
                        Beginners often
                        struggle, make mistakes, and this can be very hard on their self-esteem. At such moments, a good
                        teacher can provide
                        support. Good books can also serve this role. They remind you that mistakes are part of the
                        journey and that there
                        is light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

                    <p>I personally started with the book <strong class="orange">"Trading Chaos"</strong> by Bill
                        Williams. It impressed me
                        a lot at the time, but in practice, it turned out that things were not as simple as described.
                        This was a mixed
                        experience for me: at first, I believed the book and was disappointed, but then I found a book
                        that honestly talked
                        about the difficulties. Reading such books helped me understand that mistakes are normal, and
                        the main thing is not
                        to give up.</p>

                    <p>Good books help you deal with crises. When you're trading and taking losses, you can open a book
                        and find support
                        there. This is very valuable for a beginner trader. However, it's important to remember that
                        books are often written
                        in general terms and rarely cover specific cases. The market has many different situations, and
                        books can't cover
                        them all.</p>

                    <p>I recommend studying <strong class="orange">volume analysis</strong> to develop confidently and
                        logically think about
                        the intentions of market participants. This will help you make money.</p>
