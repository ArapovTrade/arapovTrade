                            trading</span>
                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello! I'm Igor Arapov, and today I will tell you about <strong class="orange">trading
                            platforms</strong>. I have been
                        trading for 11 years and want to explain what trading platforms are, why they are needed, and
                        how they work. Let's
                        get started!</p>
                    <p>In the past, if you have seen old movies, clients would call their brokers to buy or sell stocks.
                        Nowadays, it's
                        simpler: we use computers or phones to open trades. <strong class="orange">Trading
                            platforms</strong> are modern
                        tools that allow you to give orders to the broker to buy or sell.</p>
                    <p>When you trade through a broker, you use their <strong class="orange">trading platform</strong>.
                        Typically, it's a
                        simple terminal with "Buy" and "Sell" buttons. You give the broker a command to debit money from
                        your account and
                        buy or sell an asset. If we are talking about <strong class="orange">futures</strong>, you can
                        make contracts to buy
                        or sell assets even if you don't have them. The functionality is such that the broker executes
                        your orders in
                        real-time, and you are trading on the market, becoming a market participant.</p>
                    <p>You may see a similar screen with your broker because, as I mentioned, more professional software
                        provides more
                        capabilities. And now we will talk about it in more detail. Companies that are not brokers but
                        are interested in
                        developing these technologies release their own programs. These programs are much more
                        productive and
                        technologically advanced. These programs include not only drawing tools, such as <strong
                            class="orange">technical
                            analysis</strong>, various levels, trend channels, but also programming capabilities. You
                        can add indicators
                        here. Typically, in any such software, there are basic indicators and entire communities that
                        share systems based on
                        indicators.</p>
                    <p>Specialized software is designed not only for opening or closing trades but also for thoroughly
                        analyzing the market.
                        This is the main difference between such <strong class="orange">trading platforms</strong>. Of
                        course, if you want
                        to trade productively, it is recommended to use professional software rather than simple ones.
                        Often, experienced
                        traders combine them. For example, they analyze the market in professional software and open
                        trades in simple ones,
                        such as in the broker's regular browser window.</p>
                    <p>Another advantage of professional software is connecting many data providers. For example, by
                        entering euro-dollar,
                        you can see many providers that can provide market quotes. This allows you to choose the best
                        price and trade where
                        it is most advantageous. Having a choice is always an advantage. These programs also provide
                        access to major
                        exchanges, especially the <strong class="orange">CME</strong> futures exchange in Chicago.
                        There, we look at volume
                        data to analyze supply and demand in the world's major financial markets.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, professional programs provide more opportunities for analysis and accurate data.
                        Ordinary programs
                        from brokers are also useful but have less functionality. If you want to become a successful
                        trader, I recommend
                        using professional software for market analysis.</p>
