                    </h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov. Today we're going to talk about Pin-bars — the most
                        common figure in Japanese
                        candlesticks and I want to pay more attention to it. I previously talked about <strong
                            class="orange">"Japanese
                            candles"</strong>, what this type of chart is and why they are popular. There I briefly
                        touched on the "hammer"
                        figure.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Hammer</h3>
                    <p>Probably, it is the key figure in Japanese candlesticks, about which most has been said.
                        You can find more details about this figure in the video <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/TDuSmXiM_Vk?si=eB4MpYe9FSxrDTsY" class="orange dec">here</a>.
                        In this article, I will also spend maximum time on this figure because it is a very powerful
                        pattern in trading
                        that, if used correctly, will bring you a lot of benefits. So, let's get started.</p>
                    <p>The first thing to understand: Japanese candles are very popular because a lot has been said
                        about them in books.
                        Bars, which are usually used in volume analysis, have not gained such popularity. Volume
                        analysis itself is not a
                        popular type of market analysis. Technical market analysis, i.e. price figures and patterns, is
                        the most popular,
                        hence the advantage of Japanese candles over bars. But this is no more than a preference. You
                        can use both Japanese
                        candles and bars with the same effectiveness. Each trader eventually decides for themselves
                        which chart to use —
                        Japanese candles or bars. I personally use bars, but it doesn't matter, it's a matter of taste.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Pin-bar or up-trust</h3>
                    <p>In volume analysis — is a bar with a tail. It is very important to understand that a Pin-bar is a
                        trap bar, meaning
                        the market uses the Pin-bar to catch participants, forcing them to enter on the wrong side of
                        the market. Hence the
                        name <strong class="orange">"Pinocchio-bar"</strong> or <strong class="orange">"I fooled
                            you"</strong>. To not be
                        fooled by the market, you need to understand the current market trend. The main application of
                        the Pin-bar is to
                        hint at where the local trend will develop. The Pin-bar is formed on the chart under the
                        influence of demand and
                        supply. By analyzing the efforts of demand or supply, we can understand who is weaker and who is
                        stronger in the
                        market. Every time you see shadows on top and the price drops, you can be sure that the buyer is
                        weak. The weakness
                        of the buyer is determined by the fact that he tried to raise the price, but he couldn't, and
                        the supply in this
                        range flooded the demand. Therefore, the Pin-bar is an important signal indicating the direction
                        the trend is
                        developing. You can never argue with the trend, as the trend may develop down to the local
                        support level or go much
                        lower. If you work against the trend, you will have big problems. Always rely on Pin-bars as
                        signals in the trend.
                        They are always the market peaks, that is, in any trend, if we are talking about a bearish
                        trend, they will be the
                        peaks. You can set a stop-loss behind these shadows, which limits your risk if you have entered
                        into a sale.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, in the news Pin-bars often deceive the market because the news has high
                        volatility, the order book
                        empties and these figures work poorly there. Therefore, during the news, it is better not to use
                        them. But when the
                        market is liquid, that is, when the order book is full and a normal trading session is going on,
                        these figures are
                        an excellent signal indicating the direction the trend is developing.</p>
                    <p>In this example, we are discussing gold. You can see by the volumes that the buyer tried to buy
                        back the sales. Every
                        time the buyer tries to do something, he gives waves up, trying to raise gold, but each wave
                        ends with a Pin-bar.
                        This suggests that the level is likely to be broken down and the price will go lower.</p>
                    <p>In volume analysis, we can open a short deal, set a stop behind the Pin-bar and wait for the
                        decrease to the nearest
                        support. I hope that in this example I explained how to use the Pin-bar.</p>
