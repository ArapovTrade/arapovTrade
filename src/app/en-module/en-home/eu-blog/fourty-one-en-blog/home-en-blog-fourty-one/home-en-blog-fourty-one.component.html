                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Igor Arapov and today we will discuss the basic rules that will help you
                        improve your trading.</p>
                    <p>So, three basic rules that should not be broken: do not trade against the trend, do not risk too
                        much in one trade,
                        and always use <strong class="orange">stop-losses</strong> to control risks. By breaking these
                        rules, you risk
                        losing your deposit over time. These principles are very important for the safety of your funds
                        on the exchange. If
                        you are interested in learning more, watch my <a
                            href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdXB70rGX5_zqH_X84Q_z0wj5pQYhdqfk&si=mDbXGvJUjxqsxBED"
                            class="orange dec">previous
                            videos</a>.</p>
                    <p>Now about the good rules that help gain an edge in the market. The whole secret of a trader's
                        work lies in using all
                        possible factors that give you an advantage over the market and applying them in your trades.
                        This makes your
                        <strong class="orange">mathematical expectation</strong> positive, meaning you consistently make
                        money in the long
                        run.
                    </p>
                    <p>The first good rule is not to get stuck with one instrument. Many traders focus only on one
                        instrument, which can
                        lead to drawdowns. It is recommended to create a portfolio of several key instruments and trade
                        them when there are
                        good entry points. This helps avoid problems associated with dependence on one market and allows
                        you to choose the
                        best opportunities.</p>
                    <p>The second important rule is understanding the role of big capital and “<strong
                            class="orange">Smart Money</strong>”.
                        Do not trade against the trend, as the trend is determined by market liquidity. “Smart Money”
                        tries to enter the
                        market and move the price in their favor using volumes and liquidity. Understanding this helps
                        you identify entry
                        and exit points in the market based on <strong class="orange">volume analysis</strong>.</p>
                    <p>I hope these simple rules will help you improve your trading.</p>
