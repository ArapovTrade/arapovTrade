                            </p>

                            <h2>Basics of Japanese Candlesticks</h2>
                            <p>
                                Each Japanese candlestick consists of a body and shadows, representing the opening,
                                closing, high, and low
                                prices for a given period.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Body:</strong> Represents the range between the opening and closing prices.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Upper shadow:</strong> Shows the highest price during the period.</li>
                                <li><strong>Lower shadow:</strong> Reflects the lowest price during the period.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <div class="flex">

                            </div>
                            <p>
                                Candlesticks come in two types: bullish (green or white) and bearish (red or black). A
                                bullish candlestick
                                indicates that the closing price is higher than the opening price, while a bearish
                                candlestick shows the
                                opposite.
                            </p>

                            <h2>Key Candlestick Patterns</h2>
                            <p>
                                Candlestick patterns provide traders with clues about future price movements. Here are
                                some of the most
                                popular patterns:
                            </p>

                            <h3>Hammer and Hanging Man</h3>
                            <div class="flex">
                                <img class="pictureImgSmall" src="/assets/img/content/japanessecandle2.jpg"
                                    alt="Hammer and Hanging Man Patterns">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                These patterns have a similar structure: a small body at the top of the candlestick and
                                a long lower shadow.
                                However, their significance depends on the context.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Hammer:</strong> Forms after a downtrend. The long lower shadow indicates
                                    that sellers failed to
                                    maintain control, and the price started to reverse upwards. This is a signal to buy.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Hanging Man:</strong> Appears after an uptrend. The long lower shadow
                                    suggests weakness among
                                    buyers. This is a signal of a potential downward reversal.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h3>Engulfing</h3>
                            <div class="flex">
                                <img class="pictureImgSmall" src="/assets/img/content/japanessecandle3.jpg"
                                    alt="Engulfing Pattern">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                The Engulfing pattern consists of two candlesticks: the first has a small body, while
                                the second completely
                                "engulfs" it. This is a strong reversal signal.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Bullish Engulfing:</strong> Appears after a downtrend. The second
                                    candlestick is green,
                                    indicating the start of a new upward movement.</li>
                                <li><strong>Bearish Engulfing:</strong> Appears after an uptrend. The second candlestick
                                    is red, signaling a
                                    reversal downward.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>How to Read Candlestick Patterns?</h2>
                            <p>
                                To effectively use candlestick patterns, it’s crucial to consider market context,
                                support and resistance
                                levels, and trading volumes. Here’s an example:
                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Identify key levels on the chart.</li>

                                <li>Look for patterns such as "Hammer" or "Engulfing" at <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/levelofsupport">support or resistance
                                        levels</a>.</li>
                                <li>Confirm the signal with trading volumes: high volumes strengthen the pattern’s
                                    reliability.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h2>Volume Analysis and Candlesticks</h2>
                            <p>
                                <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/volmarketanalisys">Volume analysis</a>
                                helps determine the
                                intensity of the struggle between buyers and sellers. For instance:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>High volumes when a "Hammer" forms at a support level reinforce the buy signal.</li>
                                <li>Low volumes when a "Hanging Man" appears at a resistance level may indicate market
                                    weakness.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Practical Tips</h2>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Study candlestick patterns using historical data.</li>

                                <li>Don’t rely solely on candlesticks — consider the overall market context.</li>
                                <li>Regularly test your strategies on a demo account.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>
                                Japanese candlesticks are a powerful tool for traders. Learning patterns such as
                                "Hammer," "Hanging Man,"
