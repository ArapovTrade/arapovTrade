                    </h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone! Today we will talk about Japanese candlesticks. I will explain which candlestick
                        patterns I use in
                        trading and which ones I do not. My name is Igor Arapov, and I have been trading for over 11
                        years. I will try to
                        explain everything in a simple and understandable way.</p>

                    <p>All beginner traders get acquainted with Japanese candlesticks because it is the most popular
                        type of chart. Almost
                        all books on trading and technical analysis use candlesticks. There are many reversal formations
                        and patterns, but
                        not all of them are useful. Today I will tell you what is really useful and what is not worth
                        your time so that you
                        can develop faster and more efficiently in trading.</p>

                    <p>On the chart (more details about the chart <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/58JiqJj9Gs4?si=LaqJAHAq3XfVFCHD"
                            class="orange dec">https://youtu.be/58JiqJj9Gs4?si=LaqJAHAq3XfVFCHD</a>) you see Japanese
                        candlesticks. A
                        candlestick can be bullish or bearish. Usually, bullish candles are green, and bearish candles
                        are red. Candles have
                        parameters: open price (left), close price (right), high, and low price. If the close is higher
                        than the open, the
                        candle is green; if lower, it is red. This is the basis of Japanese candlesticks.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Formations</h3>
                    <p>Now about formations. In my experience, most formations do not work. They often work with a
                        probability of 50 to 50.
                        Therefore, I do not recommend wasting time on them. But what is really important is volume
                        analysis, which
                        complements candlestick analysis.</p>

                    <p>Volumes show the number of transactions over a certain period and help to understand the struggle
                        between supply and
                        demand. Volume analysis allows you to see market reversals that are not always visible on
                        candlesticks.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Useful Aspects of Japanese Candlestick Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Now let's talk about the useful aspects of Japanese candlestick analysis. There are two levels on
                        the chart, and we
                        will discuss the 1-2-3 rule. This is a standard rule in technical analysis that will improve the
                        quality of your
                        trades.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">1-2-3 Rule</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Point one</strong> – this is the start of the wave.</li>
                        <li><strong>Point two</strong> – this is the peak of the wave.</li>
                        <li><strong>Point three</strong> – this is the key point for entering a trade, a correction to
                            the 1-2 wave.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>At point three, we look for formations such as a "hammer" or "pin bar". These long-tail candles
                        indicate a possible
                        reversal. For example, a hammer or pin bar at a level is a signal for entry. You have a clear
                        place to set a
                        stop-loss because the price cannot be below the level.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Use the 1-2-3 rule and look for "hammer" or "pin bar" formations at levels. If your trade's ratio
                        exceeds 1 to 2, you
                        will grow your deposit. Do not be afraid of stop-losses; they control risks and protect your
                        deposit.</p>
