                    <p>Hello! My name is Igor Arapov. If you want to learn trading, this publication is for you.</p>
                    <p>Today I will tell you what you can learn from me. Trading is a broad topic with many theories and
                        articles available
                        online. Learning can take a lot of time, so I have tried to simplify it by breaking it down into
                        specific topics and
                        recording videos for each one.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I have created a course on technical analysis and the basics of trading. This will
                        help you feel
                        confident in the market. All trading boils down to simple things: levels and ranges where big
                        capital aims to
                        accumulate or offload positions. Big players are limited by liquidity and volumes, and their
                        actions can be seen in
                        the market. At levels, they sell high and buy low. You need to learn to identify these levels on
                        the chart, wait for
                        liquidity to disappear (according to the <strong class="orange">“Smart Money”</strong> concept),
                        and watch for false
                        breakouts or market shakes. This shows that big money has already sold, and the market is not
                        supported.</p>
                    <p>All you need to do is follow the patterns that are thoroughly analyzed in my lectures. Learning
                        trading is not that
                        difficult if you remove most theories that assume knowledge of indicators and chart patterns.
                        You just need to focus
                        on the right things. I recommend starting with studying levels — I have a whole playlist on this
                        topic. Then move on
                        to volumes, learn how big capital accumulates and sells assets, what liquidity is, and how to
                        work with it. After
                        that, learn about local market manipulations in the zone of key levels, such as false breakouts.
                        This will help you
                        understand what professionals think about the market.</p>
                    <p>To succeed in trading, just follow the traces of smart money on the chart and join them. Trade
                        with smart money: sell
                        when the market is expensive and buy when it is cheap. This is what trading is all about. I have
                        videos on specific
                        topics that need to be studied in detail.</p>
                    <p>I wish you successful and easy learning. I hope you avoid the mistakes of many beginners and
                        experienced traders that
                        I made. In these videos, I share my experience and tell you what not to do so that you do not
                        repeat my mistakes.
                        Any mistake in trading leads to loss of funds, so learn to control risks, set stop-losses, and
                        avoid major mistakes.
                        Then you will be successful in trading.</p>
