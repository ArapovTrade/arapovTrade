                    <p>Hello everyone! Today we will talk about an important and interesting topic â€” trend channels in
                        technical analysis.
                        Every beginner trader needs to know this. My name is Igor Arapov, I have been trading for over
                        11 years, and today I
                        will share my experience and knowledge. I hope this will be useful for you.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">The Basics of Trend Channels</h3>
                    <p>So, let's start with the basics. Trend channels show the direction of the trend. Understanding
                        whether the trend is
                        going up or down is very important to avoid making bad trades. We always look at trends on
                        longer timeframes because
                        big players in the market form the price with their money and they see the value of the
                        instrument. If you see a
                        downtrend, as in the example of the Swiss franc, it means that the franc is depreciating against
                        the dollar.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Building Trend Channels</h3>
                    <p>Now let's figure out how to build trend channels. If we want to build a bearish trend (when
                        prices are falling), we
                        need to find the highest point on the chart and the first lower high. Draw a line between these
                        two points, then
                        find the first low and draw the support line. The result is a channel where the upper line is
                        the resistance level
                        (a good point for selling), and the lower line is the support level (a place to take profit).
                        More details about
                        this chart are in this video <a class="orange dec"

                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Advantages of Trend Channels</h3>
                    <p>Trend channels help traders of all experience levels choose and secure trades. Trading with the
                        trend is always
                        profitable because for every dollar of risk, you get at least two to three dollars of profit.
                        Therefore, it is
                        important to understand the trend and build channels correctly.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Levels and Trend Channels</h3>
                    <p>You can go further and add levels to the channels. For example, to build a new uptrend (when
                        prices are rising), you
                        need to draw a line through the low and the first higher low, and draw the resistance level at
                        the high between
                        them. Now we have a new uptrend channel where the lower line is the support level (a good place
                        to buy), and the
                        upper line is the resistance level (a good place to sell).</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Using trend channels will protect you from hasty actions. The most important thing is to build
                        them on high
                        timeframes to understand the opinion of the major market participants who form the price. Join
                        the professionals and
                        trade with the trend.</p>
