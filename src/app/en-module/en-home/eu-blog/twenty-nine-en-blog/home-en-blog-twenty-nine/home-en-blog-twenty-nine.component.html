                    </h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today we will talk about a quick start in trading, or
                        how to become a
                        trader quickly.</p>

                    <p>When a beginner trader searches for trading education materials on the internet, they come across
                        an overwhelming
                        number of websites, videos, books, and articles. It is confusing, and it is unclear where to
                        start. A beginner lacks
                        experience and cannot distinguish between what is important and what is not, so they end up
                        reading everything,
                        which is very exhausting.</p>

                    <p>The problem with trading is that it is a vast topic, and much of the material on the internet is
                        disconnected from
                        reality. Among the important information, there is a lot of philosophy and speculation that do
                        not work in practice
                        and lead to losses, stress, and the desire to leave the market. This is especially true for
                        technical analysis.
                        These theories are presented as important, but in reality, they only hinder and lead to losses.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you start studying topic after topic from the internet, try it in practice, and it doesn't
                        work out, the desire to
                        engage in trading quickly fades. On my channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArapovTrade"
                            class="orange dec">https://www.youtube.com/&#64;ArapovTrade</a>, I have created playlists to
                        help you develop in
                        trading. I want to say that the channel is thematic, and I have added many topics to the
                        playlists to cover the
                        entire topic of trading. I tried to cover many topics superficially, based on my experience.</p>

                    <p>If you take a topic from the playlist and start googling, you will find many thematic pages. In
                        each video, I open
                        the tip of the iceberg to show where it will lead. The goal of the lessons is to take the
                        information I have studied
                        over 11 years and give a subjective experience: did it help me or not, will it help you or not.
                        From all this
                        experience, I can highlight two playlists that you need right away. The beauty of experience is
                        that I can tell you
                        where to start.</p>

                    <p>A trader must develop. You cannot think that by learning two or three techniques, you will become
                        successful. The
                        more you know, the better for you. But if you start correctly, you will not lose motivation. If
                        you start
                        incorrectly, motivation will disappear within the next three months. According to statistics, a
                        beginner trader
                        abandons this profession within three months and never returns, having received a negative
                        experience.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">What do you need to know to start quickly?</h3>
                    <p>I recommend getting acquainted with support and resistance levels right away. This is a full
                        course, but there are
                        specific lessons on levels. You need to get acquainted with bounces and breakouts of levels.
                        These two topics are
                        key. If you master them — it's literally a few lessons — you can already apply them. Starting on
                        a demo account, you
                        will see that it works, and you can gradually implement this on your real deposit. Just two
                        topics: level breakout
                        and level bounce. Nothing else is needed to start trading.</p>

                    <p>All other topics complement each other to create a complete picture of trading, improve your
                        entry points, add
                        varieties of these points, and make you more effective. But for a start, you only need level
                        breakout and level
                        bounce. If you learn these two topics, you can already start, and trading will not seem
                        difficult. Most importantly,
                        it will not be exhausting because you can learn trading endlessly. People study for years and do
                        not achieve
                        results. You can know everything about trading but not be a trader because all trading is about
                        the ability to buy
                        low and sell high. This is a skill, not theoretical knowledge. To develop this skill, you need
                        to learn methods to
                        develop it. By working with levels, you develop the skill of buying low and selling high. In a
                        month or two, you
                        will understand that trading is not as difficult as it seemed at the beginning, and you will
                        confidently develop.
                    </p>
