                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today we will discuss a very important topic in
                        trading — the main reason
                        for losses. Traders are divided into two groups: those who understand this and those who do not.
                        Those who
                        understand make money and take the right steps. Those who do not understand play guessing games
                        and lose money.</p>

                    <p>On my YouTube channel <a class="orange dec"
                            href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArapovTrade">www.youtube.com/&#64;ArapovTrade</a>, I have
                        already
                        talked about common trader mistakes, such as trading against the trend or overleveraging. These
                        mistakes quickly
                        lead to account losses. Today, we will talk about the most fundamental reason for losses, which
                        determines the
                        trader's future.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">The Law of Expected Value</h3>
                    <p>In our world, there are laws, such as the law of gravity. People do not fly not because they do
                        not want to, but
                        because gravity does not allow it. In trading, there is an analogous law — the <span
                            class="orange">law of expected
                            value</span>. The market by default has a negative expected value due to the spread. This
                        means that for every
                        dollar of risk, you earn slightly less, for example, 0.98 cents. This small deviation is enough
                        to leave you without
                        a deposit over a long distance.</p>

                    <p>A trader who wants to make money must change this expected value. Today, we will discuss how to
                        do this. If you can
                        change the expected value in your favor, you will trade successfully and not repeat the mistakes
                        of most traders.
                    </p>

                    <p>For example, I asked an AI to calculate the probability of 100 trades with a 33% success rate and
                        a risk/reward ratio
                        of 1 to 3. This means that for every dollar of risk, you earn three dollars. The AI calculated
                        that the average
                        expected result per trade would be 0.32 cents. This means that out of 100 trades, your average
                        profit will be 32
                        dollars. These simple calculations highlight something important: trading is not guessing, but a
                        game of
                        probabilities.</p>

                    <p>When you trade randomly, you have a negative expectation. Even a small deviation, such as minus
                        one cent, is enough
                        to lose your entire deposit over a long distance. Our task as traders is to make the average
                        expected result
                        positive.</p>

                    <p>In the "Quick Start Trading" course, I talked about trading levels. We wait at levels and look
                        for trading
                        opportunities. This helps change the expected value. By default, the market gives us a negative
                        expected value, but
                        by setting our trading parameters, we can get a positive expected value. Then everything will be
                        fine for the
                        trader.</p>

                    <p>For successful trading, you need to follow conditions where for every dollar of risk, there are
                        three dollars of
                        profit. Even if the success rate is not 50/50 but 33%, you will still be in profit over a long
                        distance. The main
                        thing is to maintain the risk/reward ratio.</p>

                    <p>Many beginner traders focus on the probability of success, trying to find trading systems with
                        almost 100%
                        probability. Such systems do not exist. On average, it is 70/30 if you follow the rules of
                        technical, volume, and
                        candlestick analysis. This is enough to be in profit. It is important to maintain the
                        risk/reward ratio.</p>

                    <p>When you make a decision to enter a trade, you must see that the movement to the resistance level
                        should be at least
                        1 to 3. If the risk/reward ratio is less, you do not trade. This ensures that you will be in
                        profit over a long
                        distance. Mathematics guarantees this.</p>

                    <p>The beauty of trading is that our actions can be expressed through mathematics. The right
                        attitude to trading and the
                        right parameters guarantee success. The laws of gravity affect us whether we want them to or
                        not. Likewise, expected
                        value affects us in trading. It can be changed by setting the right system parameters.</p>

                    <p>I hope most beginner traders will understand why there is so much negativity around trading.
                        People lose money due to
                        misunderstanding and ignorance. Most come into trading the wrong way: they start trading first
                        and then learn after
                        losses. The right attitude to trading and the right parameters guarantee success.</p>

                    <p>I hope I have clarified this fundamental reason. If you understand and use it correctly, you will
                        become a successful
                        trader. Successful traders earn more or less depending on this criterion. But for a retail
                        trader, being in profit
                        is already an achievement. Most beginner traders lose their deposit within three months.</p>
