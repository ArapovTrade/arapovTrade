                                <h2>What is an Order?</h2>
                                <p><a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/orderblockintrading">An order</a> is
                                    a
                                    trader’s instruction to the exchange to buy or sell an asset. Depending on the type
                                    of order, it can be
                                    executed immediately or when certain conditions are met.</p>

                                <p>The main purpose of orders is to automate the trading process and reduce the
                                    influence
                                    of emotions on decision-making.
                                    A trader can predefine entry and exit conditions, which is especially important
                                    in highly volatile
                                    markets.</p>

                                <h3>Order Classification</h3>
                                <p>All orders can be roughly divided into several groups:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Market Orders</strong> – immediate execution at the current market
                                        price.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Limit Orders</strong> – execution when a specified price is reached.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Stop Orders</strong> – activation when a certain level is reached.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Advanced Orders</strong> (OCO, Iceberg, Trailing Stop) – for complex
                                        trading strategies.</li>
                                </ul>

                                            Order</a> </strong> is the simplest and
                                    most common type of order,
                                    allowing you to buy or
                                    sell an asset instantly at the current market price. This order is executed
                                    immediately after
                                    being sent to the exchange, provided there is sufficient liquidity in the market.

                                <h3>How Does a Market Order Work?</h3>
                                <p>When a trader places a <strong>market order</strong>, the exchange automatically
                                    selects the best available prices for
                                    buying or selling an asset and executes the trade. Execution depends on the current
                                    order
                                    book volume.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Fast execution</strong>: the trade is completed instantly without
                                        waiting.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Ease of use</strong>: suitable for beginners as it does not require
                                        complex settings.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Useful in high volatility</strong>: allows entry or exit from the market
                                        at critical
                                        moments.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Disadvantages of Market Orders</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Slippage risk</strong>: the price may change during order processing,
                                        especially in
                                        low-liquidity markets.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Unfavorable conditions</strong>: the trade is executed at the first
                                        available price, which
                                        may not be the best.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Not suitable for large volumes</strong>: large market orders can cause
                                        significant
                                        price movement.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>When to Use a Market Order?</h3>
                                <p>Market orders are useful in situations where:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You need to quickly open or close a position.</li>
                                    <li>The price is moving rapidly, and it is crucial to enter the trade on time.</li>
                                    <li>Liquidity is high, and the spread between buy and sell prices is minimal.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Despite its convenience, <strong>experienced traders</strong> rarely use market
                                    orders as they prefer
                                    more precise control over trade execution price.</p>

                                <h2>Limit Order: How It Works and When to Use It</h2>

                                <p><strong>Limit order</strong> is an instruction to buy or sell an asset at a pre-set
                                    price
                                    or better. This order is executed only when the price reaches the specified level,
                                    allowing traders to
                                    control trade conditions.</p>

                                <h3>How Does a Limit Order Work?</h3>
                                <p>When placing a <strong>limit order</strong>, the trader specifies the desired price:
                                </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Buy limit order</strong> – placed below the current market price.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sell limit order</strong> – placed above the current market price.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>The order will be executed only when the market price reaches the specified level, or
                                    it
                                    will not be executed at all if
                                    the price never reaches it.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Price control</strong>: the trader sets a favorable price for the trade.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>No slippage</strong>: the trade is executed only at the specified price.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Suitable for large volumes</strong>: helps avoid a sudden market impact.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Often used by market makers</strong>: helps provide liquidity on the
                                        exchange.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Disadvantages of Limit Orders</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>No guarantee of execution</strong>: the price may not reach the limit,
                                        and the trade
                                        may not be opened.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Slower execution</strong>: unlike market orders, traders have to wait
                                        for the price to
                                        be reached.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>When to Use a Limit Order?</h3>
                                <p>Limit orders are suitable in the following situations:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>When a trader wants to buy an asset at a lower price or sell it at a higher
                                        price than the
                                        current market rate.</li>
                                    <li>When working with <strong>support and resistance</strong> strategies.</li>
                                    <li>For long-term investments, where getting the best price is more important than
                                        execution
                                        speed.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Limit orders are a key tool for <strong>position and algorithmic trading</strong>,
                                    as they allow traders to
                                    plan market entries and exits in advance.</p>

                                    </strong> is an order to
                                    buy or sell an
                                    asset that
                                    gets activated only when
                                    the price reaches a predefined level. Once activated, it becomes
                                    a market order.</p>

                                <h3>How Does a Stop Order Work?</h3>
                                <p>Stop orders are used for:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Buying above the current price</strong> if further growth is expected.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Selling below the current price</strong> to minimize losses in a
                                        downtrend.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Unlike limit orders, which are executed at a set price, a stop order
                                    becomes a market order and is executed
                                    at the best available price.</p>

                                <h3>Advantages of Stop Orders</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Automated capital protection</strong>: the order activates without
                                        the need for constant monitoring.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Loss limitation</strong>: protects the deposit from sharp declines.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Opportunity to catch momentum growth</strong>: allows entry into a
                                        position
                                        when a resistance level is broken.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Disadvantages of Stop Orders</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>No guarantee of a favorable price</strong>: in high volatility,
                                        a stop order may trigger at a less
                                        favorable price.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Risk of a false breakout</strong>: the price may briefly reach the level
                                        and
                                        pull back, activating the order
                                        prematurely.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>When to Use a Stop Order?</h3>
                                <p>Stop orders are most commonly used in two cases:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>To protect positions (stop-loss)</strong>: setting a price at which
                                        the position will be closed with
                                        minimal losses.</li>
                                    <li><strong>To enter a trend (stop-buy and stop-sell)</strong>: for example, when
                                        a resistance level is broken, a
                                        stop-buy order can be set to enter the trade following the trend.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Stop orders are an essential part of <strong>risk management</strong> and are used
                                    by both beginner and professional traders.</p>

                                    becomes a <strong>limit</strong> order instead of a market order. This helps avoid
                                    excessive price slippage and
                                    ensures more precise execution.</p>

                                <p>This order consists of two parameters:</p>

                                    <li><strong>Stop price</strong> – the price at which the order gets activated.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Limit price</strong> – the price at which the trade should be executed.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>When the stop price is reached, the order becomes a limit order and is executed
                                    only if the market price
                                    remains within the specified limit.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Precise price control</strong>: the order is executed only within

                                    <li><strong>Minimization of slippage</strong>: the trade does not execute at an
                                        unfavorable price.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Flexibility in risk management</strong>: useful for capital protection
                                        in high volatility.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><strong>Risk of non-execution</strong>: if the price moves beyond the limit
                                        too quickly, the order may not be filled.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Requires precise configuration</strong>: a too narrow range may cause
                                        the trade to be missed.</li>

                                    <li><strong>For profit-taking</strong>: a stop-limit order can be placed above
                                        the current price to lock in profit
                                        at a target level.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For loss limitation</strong>: setting a limit for a stop-loss
                                        reduces the risk of selling at an
                                        unfavorable price.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For market entry</strong>: when a trader expects a breakout but wants
                                        to buy an asset only up to a specific
                                        price.</li>

                                <p><strong>Trailing Stop Order</strong> is a dynamic version of a stop order that
                                    automatically adjusts
                                    the stop-loss level as the price moves. This allows traders to protect profits
                                    and minimize losses without
                                    the need for constant market monitoring.</p>

                                <p>This order is linked to the asset’s price with a specified step:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>For long positions</strong>: the stop level moves up as the asset price
                                        increases.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For short positions</strong>: the stop level moves down as the price
                                        falls.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>As soon as the price changes in the opposite direction by a set percentage or
                                    a fixed number of
                                    points, the order is triggered, and the position is closed.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Maximization of profits</strong>: allows holding a position in a trend

                                    <li><strong>For active trading</strong>: reduces the need for constant

                                <p>When one of the orders is triggered, the other is immediately canceled. This is
                                    useful in
                                    situations where a trader wants to either
                                    lock in profits or exit a position in case of an unfavorable price movement.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Automated trading</strong>: the trader does not need to manually cancel
                                        one of the orders.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Profit protection and loss limitation</strong>: the trade is managed
                                        with two strategies simultaneously.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Convenience for breakouts</strong>: allows setting orders to enter

                                    <li><strong>Risk of premature triggering</strong>: in high volatility, the price may

                                    <li><strong>For managing open positions</strong>: one order locks in profits,
                                        while the other protects against
                                        losses.</li>
                                    <li><strong>When trading at key levels</strong>: useful for placing orders near
                                        major support and

                                <h2>Iceberg Order: Hidden Large Trades</h2>

                                <p><strong>Iceberg Order</strong> is a special type of limit order that hides its full
                                    volume, displaying only a small portion of the order in the order book. This
                                    approach allows
                                    large investors and market makers to execute trades without significantly impacting
                                    the market.</p>

                                <h3>How Does an Iceberg Order Work?</h3>
                                <p>An Iceberg Order is divided into several parts:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Only a specific portion of the volume (the so-called "tip of the iceberg") is
                                        visible
                                        in the order book.</li>
                                    <li>When the visible portion is executed, a new part of the order is automatically
                                        placed
                                        in its place.</li>
                                    <li>This process repeats until the entire hidden order is executed.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>This mechanism allows large players to buy or sell significant volumes of assets
                                    without causing sharp price movements.</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Strategy concealment</strong>: other traders cannot see the full order
                                        volume.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reduced market impact</strong>: helps prevent sharp price jumps.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Suitable for large players</strong>: used by institutional investors
                                        and market makers.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>May not be fully executed</strong>: if the market reverses,
                                        the remaining portion of the order will not be completed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Not suitable for urgent trades</strong>: execution may take time.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Can be identified by experienced traders</strong>: although the volume
                                        is hidden,
                                        some algorithms can detect the presence of an Iceberg Order.</li>
                                </ul>

                                    <li><strong>For hidden buying and selling</strong>: does not attract attention
                                        from other market participants.</li>
                                    <li><strong>When working with low-liquidity assets</strong>: helps prevent sharp
                                        price spikes.</li>

                                <h2>FOK and IOC Orders: Immediate Execution or Cancellation</h2>

                                <p><strong>FOK (Fill or Kill)</strong> and <strong>IOC (Immediate or Cancel)</strong>
                                    are special types of orders used for rapid trade execution. They allow traders to
                                    control
                                    order execution while avoiding partial fills.</p>

                                <h3>What Is an FOK Order?</h3>
                                <p><strong>FOK (Fill or Kill) – "Execute or Cancel"</strong> is an order that must be
                                    fully
                                    executed at the specified price or immediately canceled.</p>

                                <p>An FOK order is used in situations where a trader does not want partial execution and
                                    aims
                                    to buy or sell an asset in a single transaction.</p>

                                <h3>What Is an IOC Order?</h3>
                                <p><strong>IOC (Immediate or Cancel) – "Execute Immediately or Cancel"</strong> is an
                                    order
                                    that executes immediately, but if it cannot be fully completed, the unfilled portion
                                    is canceled.</p>

                                <p>IOC orders are often used in highly volatile markets where at least part of the order
                                    can be executed.</p>

                                <h3>Advantages of FOK and IOC Orders</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Execution control</strong>: prevents partial execution (FOK) or allows
                                        execution
                                        of the maximum possible volume (IOC).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fast execution</strong>: either executes immediately or is canceled.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Useful in high-frequency trading</strong>: commonly used in algorithmic
                                        strategies.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Disadvantages of FOK and IOC Orders</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Not suitable for low-liquidity assets</strong>: the order may be
                                        canceled
                                        if there is insufficient volume in the order book.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Risk of complete cancellation</strong>: particularly for FOK, if there
                                        are not
                                        enough orders at the required price.</li>
                                    <li><strong>May increase trading fees</strong>: frequent order cancellations can
                                        raise trading costs.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>When to Use FOK and IOC Orders?</h3>
                                <p>These orders are useful in the following situations:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>For large trades</strong>: helps avoid partial execution.</li>
                                    <li><strong>During high volatility</strong>: ensures quick execution in sharp price
                                        movements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For algorithmic trading</strong>: used in HFT (high-frequency trading)
                                        strategies.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>FOK and IOC orders give traders precise control over order execution and allow
                                    for rapid market entry or exit.</p>

                                <p><strong>Market-if-Touched (MIT)</strong> and <strong>Limit-if-Touched (LIT)</strong>
                                    orders are conditional orders that are activated when a specific price level is
                                    reached.
                                    These orders are used for automatic entry or exit from a trade when the price
                                    reaches the set level.</p>

                                <h3>What Is a Market-if-Touched (MIT) Order?</h3>
                                <p><strong>MIT (Market Order if Touched)</strong> is an order that becomes a market
                                    order
                                    once the asset price reaches the specified level.</p>

                                <p>This order is used when a trader wants to enter a trade only after the price reaches
                                    the desired level but does not want to place a stop order.</p>

                                <h3>What Is a Limit-if-Touched (LIT) Order?</h3>
                                <p><strong>LIT (Limit Order if Touched)</strong> is an order that becomes a limit order
                                    after reaching the specified price.</p>

                                <p>Unlike MIT, LIT allows the trader to control the execution price after order
                                    activation.</p>

                                <h3>Advantages of MIT and LIT Orders</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Automatic execution</strong>: orders activate without the need for
                                        monitoring.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: can be adjusted for the desired price movement
                                        scenario.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Helps enter a trend</strong>: MIT can be used to enter a trade when a
                                        breakout is confirmed.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Disadvantages of MIT and LIT Orders</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>No guarantee of execution at a favorable price (MIT)</strong>: once
                                        activated,
                                        the order becomes a market order and may be executed at a less desirable price.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>LIT may not be fully executed</strong>: if the price changes sharply,
                                        the limit order may not trigger.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>When to Use MIT and LIT Orders?</h3>
                                <p>These orders are useful in the following situations:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>For entering a trend</strong>: MIT can be used to buy after a breakout.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>For automatic position opening</strong>: when a trader does not want
                                        to use market or stop orders.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For advanced strategies</strong>: LIT helps combine the benefits of
                                        limit and stop orders.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p><strong>MIT and LIT orders</strong> are suitable for experienced traders who want
                                    to automate trades and control entry and exit points.</p>

                                <h2>Which Order to Choose?</h2>

                                <p>In trading, it is important not only to analyze the market correctly but also to
                                    effectively use
                                    different <strong>types of orders</strong>. The choice of order determines the speed
                                    of execution,
                                    risk level, and the overall trading outcome.</p>

                                <h3>Which Order Is Best to Use?</h3>
                                <p>The choice of order depends on the trading style:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>For quick entry or exit</strong> – a <strong>market order</strong> is
                                        best.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For precise price control</strong> – a <strong>limit order</strong> is
                                        suitable.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For loss protection</strong> – a <strong>stop-loss or trailing
                                            stop</strong> is necessary.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For trade automation</strong> – <strong>OCO or MIT</strong> orders are
                                        recommended.</li>
                                    <li><strong>For large trades</strong> – an <strong>Iceberg Order</strong> is
                                        beneficial.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Tips for Using Orders</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Avoid relying only on market orders – they may lead to slippage.</li>
                                    <li>Set stop orders to limit potential losses.</li>
                                    <li>Use OCO orders for automatic trade exits.</li>
                                    <li>In low-liquidity markets, limit orders are preferable.</li>
                                    <li>Combine different orders for better trade control.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Understanding how different <strong>types of orders</strong> work and using them
                                    correctly
                                    is the key to successful trading. Choose strategies that fit your needs and apply
                                    orders
                                    according to your trading goals.</p>
