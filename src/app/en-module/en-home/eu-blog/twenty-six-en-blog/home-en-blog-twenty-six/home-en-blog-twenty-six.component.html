                    </h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone! Today we will talk about an important topic – types and kinds of orders. I have
                        already touched on
                        this topic in previous articles about pricing and liquidity, and I recommend everyone to read
                        them. So now let's
                        take a closer look at what types of orders there are, how they affect the price and the
                        formation of the order book.
                    </p>

                    <p>Understanding these elements, known as market microstructure, is necessary for the introduction
                        to volume market
                        analysis. Without understanding what we are going to talk about today, it is impossible to
                        analyze volumes, search
                        for smart money, or large players. So, let's start.</p>

                    <p>As I have already said, the price in the market is always formed by two sides of participants. On
                        one side are the
                        sellers (ask or offer price), on the other side — the buyers (bid price). In the order book, the
                        bid price shows the
                        level at which buyers are willing to buy an asset, for example, Bitcoin. Values in the bid
                        column usually change
                        very quickly, especially during active trading and news when the hype is high.</p>

                    <p>It is important to understand that we consider the order book as a moment in time, as if we froze
                        the market and
                        analyzed what was at that moment. In the order book by price, there is a certain number of
                        orders waiting to be
                        executed (buyer's price), and in the ask/offer column — seller's orders. Limit orders are
                        matched with market
                        orders. For a seller to sell a product at the market price, there must be a buyer who, using a
                        market order, will
                        buy the asset at that price and volume.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Types of Orders</h3>
                    <p>To match these types of orders, we need two types of orders. It may seem complicated, but I will
                        try to explain. On
                        one side, we have pending orders that are in the order book, and on the other — market orders
                        that are executed here
                        and now. A market order must be executed at the market price instantly. Pending orders are
                        divided into limit,
                        stop-limit, and stop orders, but market orders have only two values: buy and sell, and are
                        executed as quickly as
                        possible. A pending order may or may not be executed.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Impact on Price</h3>
                    <p>By how they affect the price, limit buy orders are support from below, and limit sell orders are
                        resistance from
                        above. This is essentially a reflection of the levels on the chart, only the spread between them
                        can change.</p>

                    <p>Market buyers with buy stops try to break the resistance and raise the price, while market
                        sellers with sell stops
                        try to break the support and lower the price. This is the nature of the influence of market
                        orders on the current
                        price. Accordingly, if a trader analyzes supply and demand, volume formation, and so on, he can
                        determine from the
                        order book how many buyers and sellers there are now and in which direction the imbalance will
                        be directed. This
                        gives a huge advantage over those who just look at the price or use indicators.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Pending Orders</h3>
                    <p>About pending orders, I will add the following. They are used not only to fill the order book but
                        also as a method of
                        fixing profits. Large players who buy a product cheaply and want to sell it more expensively use
                        limit orders. Large
                        players buy on the fall with limit orders so as not to affect the price, as market orders always
                        affect the price.
                        If the orders are very large, the large player will get a bad execution price. Therefore, they
                        try to buy and sell
                        with limit orders. They buy from small participants who sell en masse at the breakout of the
                        level, allowing large
                        players to buy or fix profits.</p>

                    <p>Conversely, in a rising market, a large player can sell to small participants who are actively
                        buying. This
                        technology has an accumulation phase and a distribution phase, used in volume analysis to
                        determine potential
                        reversal points.</p>

                    <p>I recommend understanding how the price is formed in the market, what an offer and bid are, how
                        market orders are
                        matched with these orders, and what information this gives for determining the future price and
                        prospects of large
                        players.</p>
