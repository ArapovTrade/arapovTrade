                    </h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today I will tell you about the "flag" pattern. I
                        have previously
                        mentioned that I do not often use patterns because they are not particularly useful. But the
                        "flag" is an
                        interesting pattern in terms of price projection.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">What is a "flag"?</h3>
                    <p>First, you need to understand what a "flag" is. It is a pattern that begins with an impulsive
                        price rise. If we look
                        at the volumes, we will see that there are extremely high volumes at the bottom, indicating a
                        supply shortage.
                        Therefore, buyers are forced to raise prices, and then the price enters a long sideways
                        movement. This sideways
                        movement can vary in shape, appearance, and volatility, but the price moves within a certain
                        range. This can last
                        from a day to a week or longer, depending on the timeframe. By the way, I recommend looking for
                        such formations on
                        higher timeframes, from four hours and up. Intraday formations are less effective.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">The Importance of Time and Volume</h3>
                    <p>Why? Because time is a valuable resource in the market. During the sideways movement, open
                        interest decreases: the
                        price moves up and down, and market participants place speculative positions. And before exiting
                        the sideways
                        movement, something interesting happens: the continuation of the rise usually coincides in
                        magnitude with the
                        previous impulse. It is difficult to explain, but it happens. You can consider this or not, but
                        I personally take
                        this into account when trading the "flag". I expect at least the same rise up.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">False Breakout</h3>
                    <p>The longer the sideways movement lasts, the more likely a false breakout. If the flag reverses
                        upwards, then before
                        that, the price sharply dives down: it knocks out buyers' stops, pulls into shorts those who
                        work on the level
                        breakout, and then sharply reverses and goes up. This formation is rare in the market, but if
                        you see it, it is
                        useful. A false breakout is a manipulation, and it means there are intentions of large
                        participants that can be
                        traced here. We can also understand the approximate range of price movement.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Of all the technical analysis patterns, I like the "flag" the most because it has a logical
                        rationale for how to work
                        with it and approximate targets for the trade.</p>
