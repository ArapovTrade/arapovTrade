                                <h2>What is Smart Money?</h2>
                                <p>The term <strong>Smart Money</strong> refers to capital managed by large
                                    institutional players, banks,
                                    hedge funds, and market makers. These participants have significant resources,
                                    insider information,
                                    and access to advanced trading strategies.</p>

                                <p>The core idea of the Smart Money concept in trading is understanding how these major
                                    players form trends,
                                    manage liquidity, and use market manipulations to maximize profits. They do not
                                    simply follow the market
                                    but actively control its movement, creating strategic entry and exit points that
                                    work to their
                                    advantage.</p>

                                <h3>Main Objectives of Smart Money:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Accumulating positions</strong> before significant price movements. They
                                        accumulate large
                                        asset volumes without causing sharp price jumps.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity and manipulation</strong> – creating artificial price
                                        movements to drive the
                                        market to desired levels and force retail traders into making incorrect
                                        decisions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Stop-loss hunting</strong> – forcing retail traders to liquidate
                                        positions, allowing large
                                        players to enter at better prices with reduced risk.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Creating false breakouts</strong> – misleading market participants by
                                        generating false buy
                                        or sell signals.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>How Does Smart Money Control the Market?</h3>
                                <p>The market is structured so that retail traders mostly behave predictably: placing
                                    stop orders around
                                    support and resistance levels. Smart Money takes advantage of this predictability by
                                    creating false
                                    breakouts to "collect" liquidity.</p>

                                <p>Additionally, large players use various methods to manipulate the market:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity manipulation:</strong> Artificially creating a supply or
                                        demand deficit to change
                                        an asset’s value.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Trend reversals:</strong> Establishing long consolidations before
                                        pushing the price in an
                                        unexpected direction.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Simulating demand and supply:</strong> Placing large orders in the order
                                        book to provoke
                                        mass buying or selling.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Example of How Smart Money Works:</h3>
                                <p>Imagine an asset's price is moving within a range. Large players identify where
                                    retail traders have
                                    placed their stop-losses and deliberately push the price toward these levels,
                                    creating a false movement.
                                    Once the stop-losses are triggered, they initiate the actual price movement in the
                                    opposite direction.
                                </p>
                                <p>This process happens as follows:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Range formation:</strong> The price moves within a narrow corridor,
                                        attracting traders' attention.</li>
                                    <li><strong>False breakout:</strong> The price moves beyond the range boundaries,
                                        attracting new participants
                                        and forcing retail traders to enter the market.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity absorption:</strong> Large players absorb retail traders'
                                        orders, increasing the volume
                                        of their positions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reversal and momentum:</strong> After gathering liquidity, the price
                                        sharply reverses, and
                                        Smart Money starts moving in their intended direction.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <h3>Why is it important to understand the Smart Money concept?</h3>
                                <p>Knowing how large players operate allows retail traders to:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Avoid common traps such as false breakouts and stop-loss hunting.</li>
                                    <li>Find more precise entry points by utilizing accumulation and liquidity zones.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Adapt their strategies to align with large players' actions rather than
                                        following the crowd.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Understanding the Smart Money concept is a step toward more informed and profitable
                                    trading, where you trade
                                    alongside major players rather than against them.</p>

                                <h2>Key Principles of Smart Money Trading</h2>
                                <p>To effectively apply the <strong>Smart Money</strong> concept in trading,
                                    it is essential to understand the main mechanisms used by large players. This will
                                    help not only to avoid
                                    manipulations but also to join institutional movements.</p>

                                <h3>1. Accumulation and Distribution</h3>
                                <p>The market moves in phases, which include:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Accumulation phase</strong> — large players buy assets at low prices
                                        before
                                        an upward movement.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Distribution phase</strong> — institutional traders sell assets before
                                        a price decline.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <div class="flex">

                                </div>

                                <h3>2. Liquidity Manipulation</h3>
                                <p>Institutions look for <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/ru/freestudying/pricingandliquidity">liquidity</a>
                                    in areas with a high concentration of stop-losses and pending
                                    orders. Often, the price makes a sharp move in the opposite direction, gathering
                                    liquidity before the real
                                    movement.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>False breakouts</strong> – an artificial move above/below a level
                                        followed by a reversal.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Pre-news manipulations</strong> – sharp movements before significant
                                        economic events.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Special liquidity zones</strong> – areas where institutions "collect"
                                        stop orders.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>3. Using Market Structure</h3>
                                <p>Understanding market structure helps identify where real Smart Money entry points
                                    are.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Trend zones:</strong> Smart Money joins trends during pullbacks.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Impulses and corrections:</strong> entries occur after liquidity has
                                        been gathered.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Imbalance levels:</strong> areas where the price changed direction
                                        sharply become key zones.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>How to Identify Smart Money Activity?</h2>
                                <p>There are several key indicators and signs that indicate the presence of large
                                    players:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Abnormally high volumes</strong> — a signal that large traders are
                                        entering
                                        or exiting the market. Such volumes are usually observed near key support
                                        and resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity zones</strong> — levels where high activity is expected.
                                        These may include clusters of stop-losses
                                        or buy/sell orders that large players use for position accumulation.</li>
                                    <li><strong>False breakouts</strong> — sudden price spikes before the actual move.
                                        Smart Money often uses this tactic to "shake out" retail traders from their
                                        positions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Impulse candles</strong> — strong movements after long periods of
                                        consolidation.
                                        This indicates active actions by large players who are either accumulating
                                        or distributing their positions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Accumulation zones</strong> — sideways movement periods with low
                                        volatility,
                                        where large players prepare
                                        for a significant move.</li>

                                <p>Suppose the 1.2000 level on EUR/USD acts as strong support. Retail
                                    traders place stop-losses below this level.
                                    Institutions may artificially push the price below 1.2000, triggering stop-losses,
                                    and
                                    then quickly reverse the price upward, creating a new
                                    upward movement.</p>

                                <p>Stages of such manipulation:</p>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity search:</strong> Large players identify where retail traders'
                                        stop-losses are concentrated.
                                        These are usually areas beyond obvious support or resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Level breakout:</strong> The price artificially moves in the opposite
                                        direction of the main trend to activate orders.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sharp reversal:</strong> After liquidity is gathered, the price quickly
                                        returns to its original direction,
                                        leaving retail traders at a loss.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <p>Large market participants, such as banks and hedge funds, execute trades in large
                                    volumes, which requires liquidity. To find liquidity, Smart Money uses specific
                                    tactics
                                    aimed at collecting retail traders' stop orders.</p>

                                <h3>What Are Liquidity Zones?</h3>
                                <p>Liquidity zones are areas on the chart where a large number of orders are
                                    concentrated
                                    (stop-losses, limit orders, and pending orders).</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Stop-loss clustering zones:</strong> areas above or below significant
                                        levels where retail traders place protective orders.</li>
                                    <li><strong>High activity areas:</strong> locations where sharp price reversals or
                                        position accumulation occurred.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Manipulation levels:</strong> zones where false breakouts and liquidity
                                        collection often happen.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Types of Liquidity Zones</h3>
                                <p>Liquidity zones can be divided into several categories:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Local extremes:</strong> highs and lows where traders place stop-losses.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Support and resistance levels:</strong> key zones where large players'
                                        orders are concentrated.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Consolidation zones:</strong> sideways movement before an impulsive
                                        move where positions are accumulated.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Smart Money uses various strategies to extract liquidity:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>False breakouts (Fakeouts):</strong> the price sharply breaks a level,
                                        triggers stop orders, and then reverses back.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Impulsive moves before a reversal:</strong> before a trend shift, the
                                        price makes a strong push to gather liquidity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Special "traps" for retail traders:</strong> large players create the
                                        illusion of a trend, luring small participants into a trap.</li>

                                        levels can signal large players' actions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Rapid liquidity absorption:</strong> after breaking a level, the price
                                        quickly returns back.</li>

                                <h3>Example of Manipulation</h3>
                                <p>Suppose EUR/USD is moving in a sideways channel with strong support at 1.1000. Many
                                    traders place stop-losses below this level. Large players may intentionally push the
                                    price down to 1.0980, trigger stop orders, and then sharply reverse the movement
                                    upward.</p>

                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/orderblockintrading">Order Blocks</a>
                                    are areas on the chart where large players, such as banks and institutional
                                    investors, accumulate positions before a significant price movement. These
                                    blocks often become key support or resistance levels.</p>

                                <h3>What Are Order Blocks?</h3>
                                <p>An order block is the last bullish or bearish candlestick before a sharp price
                                    move in the opposite direction. These levels serve as points of interest for
                                    Smart Money, as large players often return to them to replenish their positions.</p>

                                <h3>Types of Order Blocks</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Bullish Order Block:</strong> the zone from which a strong upward
                                        movement started.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Bearish Order Block:</strong> the area from which a powerful
                                        downward movement began.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Reaccumulation Zones:</strong> areas where large players continue
                                        to accumulate positions before trend continuation.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>How to Identify Order Blocks?</h3>
                                <p>There are several signs that help identify order blocks:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Impulse Movement:</strong> the price moves sharply after the
                                        block formation, confirming the presence of large capital.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Return to the Level:</strong> the price often tests order blocks
                                        before continuing its movement.</li>
                                    <li><strong>High Volumes:</strong> these zones often show abnormal trading
                                        activity.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>What Is Imbalance?</h3>
                                <p>Imbalance occurs when there is a difference between supply and demand,
                                    typically caused by large participants executing significant trades. In such
                                    cases, the price moves sharply in one direction, leaving "unfilled" zones on
                                    the chart.</p>

                                <h3>How to Identify Imbalance on the Chart?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Long Impulse Candles:</strong> if the price rapidly moves up or
                                        down without pullbacks, it could be an imbalance.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Lack of Liquidity:</strong> in such zones, there are no
                                        significant corrections or retests.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Gaps on the Chart:</strong> in some cases, price gaps (especially
                                        in the stock market) indicate a sharp change in supply or demand.</li>

                                <p>Traders can use imbalances as target levels:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Waiting for a Return to the Imbalance:</strong> the market often
                                        returns to such zones to "fill" liquidity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Using Imbalance as an Entry Point:</strong> if the price returns
                                        to the imbalance, it may be a good zone to enter a trade in the direction
                                        of the previous impulse.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Order Blocks vs. Liquidity Zones</h3>
                                <p>Although order blocks and liquidity zones often overlap, they are not the same:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity Zones:</strong> represent areas where retail traders’
                                        stop orders are concentrated.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Order Blocks:</strong> indicate locations where large players
                                        accumulate positions.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Markets do not move randomly but are influenced by large capital (Smart Money),
                                    which controls liquidity and creates price manipulations to maximize profits.
                                    These manipulations are primarily aimed at trapping retail traders into
                                    losing trades.</p>

                                <h3>Main Smart Money Manipulations</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Stop Hunt:</strong> an artificial price movement designed to
                                        trigger retail traders' stop orders before the main trend movement.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity Grab:</strong> large players push the price beyond
                                        support or resistance levels to collect liquidity before reversing the
                                        direction.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Fake Breakout:</strong> the price breaks a key level, luring
                                        traders into a false position, then sharply reverses in the opposite direction.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>How to Identify Manipulations by Large Players?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Sharp moves before major news:</strong> large players often
                                        move the market to create false signals before news events.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Large candlestick wicks:</strong> indicate the presence of
                                        a false breakout and liquidity grab.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Sharp volume spikes:</strong> before strong price movements,
                                        volumes increase significantly, which may signal Smart Money intervention.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h2>Wyckoff Methodology and Smart Money</h2>
                                <p>Richard Wyckoff developed a concept explaining how large players control
                                    price movement. The core idea of the Wyckoff method is the accumulation
                                    and distribution cycle, which helps predict future market movements.
                                    This methodology remains relevant even in modern, high-tech financial markets.</p>

                                <h3>Market Phases According to Wyckoff</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Accumulation Phase:</strong> large players buy assets at
                                        low prices while retail traders panic-sell. This phase is characterized
                                        by sideways price movement with low volatility and is often accompanied
                                        by candlestick patterns like "pin bars."</li>
                                    <li><strong>Markup Phase:</strong> a strong upward trend begins after
                                        liquidity accumulation. This phase features impulsive candlesticks,
                                        increased volumes, and breakouts of key resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Distribution Phase:</strong> large players sell assets to
                                        retail traders at high prices. The price moves within a range,
                                        where significant activity is observed at resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Markdown Phase:</strong> after distribution, the price drops sharply.
                                        This phase is often accompanied by increased volatility and false breakouts
                                        of key support levels.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Key Elements of Wyckoff</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Selling Climax:</strong> in the accumulation phase, the price
                                        reaches a minimum at high volumes, after which consolidation begins.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Buying Climax:</strong> in the distribution phase, the price
                                        reaches a maximum, accompanied by a sharp increase in volumes.</li>
                                    <li><strong>False Breakouts:</strong> Smart Money often uses them to collect
                                        liquidity before initiating a new trend.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Level Testing:</strong> in the accumulation and distribution phases,
                                        large players test support or resistance levels to assess the activity
                                        of other market participants.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Identify the market phase:</strong> use volume analysis and price
                                        structure.
                                        Pay attention to characteristic candlestick patterns such as "doji" or
                                        "engulfing".</li>
                                    <li><strong>Watch for manipulations:</strong> false breakouts, liquidity grabs, and
                                        volume spikes indicate the actions of large players.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Enter trades in the markup or markdown phase:</strong> avoid entering
                                        the market during accumulation or distribution phases until movement
                                        confirmation occurs.</li>

                                <h2>How Does Smart Money Use Wyckoff?</h2>
                                <p>Large players manipulate liquidity using the Wyckoff strategy to create price traps.
                                    They implement accumulation and distribution phases to "shake out" retail traders
                                    from the market. Understanding these phases helps traders avoid traps and follow
                                    the trend.</p>

                                <h3>Example Trading Strategy</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li>Identify the accumulation or distribution phase. Use support and resistance
                                        levels to determine key zones.</li>
                                    <li>Wait for confirmation of an impulse move with high volume. This could be a
                                        breakout of the accumulation range.</li>
                                    <li>Use technical <a class="linkrefinto"
                                            href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/tradingindicators">indicators</a>,
                                        such as MACD or RSI, for additional trend confirmation.</li>
                                    <li>Secure profits in the markup or markdown phase, following the trend until
                                        signs of distribution appear.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <h3>Additional Recommendations</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Pay attention to volumes:</strong> Abnormally high volumes at support
                                        or resistance levels may indicate Smart Money activity.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Look for consolidations:</strong> Sideways movement zones are often
                                        accumulation or distribution phases.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Track breakout dynamics:</strong> Genuine breakouts are typically
                                        accompanied by sharp volume increases and sustained price movement.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Smart Money traps are price manipulations designed to lure retail traders
                                    into losing positions and collect their liquidity. These traps force
                                    inexperienced participants to make poor trading decisions.</p>

                                <h3>Types of Smart Money Traps</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Fake Breakouts:</strong> the price moves beyond a <a class="linkrefinto"

                                    <li><strong>Stop Hunt:</strong> an artificial price movement knocks out
                                        stop orders and then returns to the original range.</li>
                                    <li><strong>News Manipulations:</strong> sharp movements before significant
                                        economic events, followed by a reversal.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Retest After Breakout:</strong> the price breaks a level, then
                                        returns to it, creating a false sense of trend continuation.</li>

                                    <li><strong>Use volume analysis:</strong> during a fake breakout, volumes
                                        spike sharply and then drop.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Monitor market structure:</strong> traps often occur at key levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Wait for confirmation:</strong> do not enter trades immediately
                                        after a breakout, allow the price to consolidate.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use multi-timeframe analysis:</strong> higher timeframes provide
                                        a clearer picture of market structure.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <h3>Example of a Smart Money Trap</h3>
                                <p>Suppose a resistance level has formed in the market, and most traders
                                    expect a breakout. Large players artificially push the price above this
                                    level, triggering retail traders' buy orders. Then they sharply reverse
                                    the price downward, stopping them out.</p>

                                <h3>Trading Against Smart Money</h3>
                                <p>To trade successfully, it is crucial not to fight against large players
                                    but to follow their movements. This requires patience and an analysis
                                    of their manipulations.</p>

                                <p>Liquidity plays a key role in Smart Money actions. They use various traps
                                    to force retail traders into losing trades. Understanding these mechanisms
                                    allows traders to avoid traps and align with large players’ movements.</p>

                                <h2>Liquidity and Its Role in the Smart Money Strategy</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Liquidity is the volume of available buy and sell orders at different price levels.
                                    In financial markets, it plays a crucial role, especially for major participants
                                    such as hedge funds, market makers, and banks. These players cannot simply enter
                                    the market without creating significant price movement, so they employ strategic
                                    liquidity management methods.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Understanding liquidity mechanics allows retail traders to predict market movements
                                    and identify favorable entry and exit points. Smart Money uses liquidity not only
                                    for position accumulation but also for price manipulation, creating false breakouts
                                    and artificial impulses to shake out weaker traders.
                                </p>

                                    <li><strong>Retail traders' stop orders:</strong> Placed around support and
                                        resistance
                                        levels, attracting the attention of large players.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Large institutional investor orders:</strong> Positioned in key price
                                        zones
                                        and can form support or resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>High volatility areas:</strong> Smart Money uses sharp price movements
                                        to gather liquidity before the main impulse.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Accumulation zones:</strong> Price consolidation within a narrow range
                                        indicates the presence of large players preparing the market for a major move.
                                    </li>

                                <p>
                                    Large market participants control price movement by creating artificial support
                                    and resistance levels, false breakouts, and liquidity grabs. Their primary goal
                                    is to accumulate enough positions before directing the price in the desired
                                    direction.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Smart Money Strategies for Liquidity Management:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity trap:</strong> Large players artificially push the price below
                                        a key support level to trigger mass selling. They then buy assets at a low price
                                        and drive the price upward.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Stop-loss manipulation:</strong> Retail traders place <a
                                            class="linkrefinto"
                                            href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/stoploss">stop-losses</a>
                                        near support or resistance levels. Smart Money initiates sharp movements to
                                        trigger these stops, after which the price reverses.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Accumulation and distribution phases:</strong> Before a trend begins,
                                        the market often consolidates. Large players use this time to discreetly
                                        accumulate positions, creating an illusion of uncertainty.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>
                                    Understanding these processes allows retail traders to make more informed decisions
                                    and follow the movements of large players instead of falling victim to their
                                    manipulations.

                                <h2>How to Apply the Smart Money Concept in Trading?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Now that we have covered the basics of Smart Money, it is important to understand
                                    how to apply this knowledge in practice. The main goal of a retail trader is not
                                    to compete with large players but to follow their movements. This means learning
                                    to recognize market phases, liquidity zones, and signals that indicate institutional
                                    activity.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Key Principles of Smart Money Trading</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity Analysis:</strong> Identify where stop-loss clusters and
                                        other participants’ orders are located. These zones often become targets
                                        for major price movements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Identifying Accumulation Zones:</strong> Before a strong move,
                                        Smart Money creates consolidation areas where they secretly accumulate
                                        positions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Following Volume:</strong> Large price movements start with increased
                                        volume. A volume surge during a breakout confirms the strength of the impulse.
                                    </li>
                                    <li><strong>Using Market Structure:</strong> Identify trends, potential reversals,
                                        and price behavior patterns.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Risk Control:</strong> Smart Money can create false breakouts, so it is
                                        essential to use confirmation signals and set proper stop-loss levels.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Steps for Trading with the Smart Money Strategy</h3>
                                <ol>
                                    <li><strong>Identify the Zone of Interest:</strong> Find areas of high liquidity
                                        where major players are likely to act.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Monitor Price Behavior:</strong> Watch for false breakouts, abnormal
                                        volumes, and reactions at support/resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Look for Confirmation Signals:</strong> Use <a class="linkrefinto"
                                            href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/volmarketanalisys">volume

                                        candlestick patterns, and indicators to filter out false signals.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Enter a Position:</strong> Once the direction of movement is confirmed,
                                        enter a trade with expectations of trend continuation.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Exit at Take-Profit or Structural Change:</strong> Secure profits at
                                        predetermined levels without waiting for a full trend reversal.</li>
                                </ol>

                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Monitor Fundamental Events:</strong> News and macroeconomic reports
                                        can act as catalysts for Smart Money movements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Use Multi-Timeframe Analysis:</strong> Determine the global trend
                                        on higher timeframes (D1, H4) and look for entries on lower timeframes (H1,
                                        M15).</li>
                                    <li><strong>Be Patient:</strong> Smart Money operates slowly, concealing their
                                        intentions. Wait for a clear signal before entering a trade.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Avoid Trading in Chaotic Zones:</strong> If the price moves without
                                        structure, the market is likely in an accumulation or distribution phase.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>
                                    The Smart Money concept helps traders understand how large players operate and
                                    manage liquidity. Applying this knowledge in practice improves entry accuracy,
                                    avoids false breakouts, and aligns trading with professional market participants.

                                <h3>1. Trading Liquidity Manipulations</h3>
                                <p>Smart Money often uses stop hunting to gather liquidity before a strong
                                    move. Traders can use this to their advantage.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Identify levels where <a class="linkrefinto"

                                        may be located (beyond support or resistance).</li>

                                    <li>Enter a trade in the direction of the main trend.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>2. Trading Imbalance Zones</h3>
                                <p>After strong impulsive moves, imbalance zones remain on the chart, where
                                    the price may return for a retest.</p>

                                    <li>Identify sharp movements without significant corrections.</li>
                                    <li>Wait for the price to return to this area.</li>
                                    <li>Look for confirmation signals before entering.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>3. Trading Pullbacks to Key Levels</h3>
                                <p>After a level breakout, the price often returns to retest it. This is a
                                    good opportunity to enter the market with low risk.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Identify support or resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li>Wait for a breakout and price consolidation above/below.</li>
                                    <li>Enter on the retest of the level with a confirmation signal.</li>
                                </ul>
