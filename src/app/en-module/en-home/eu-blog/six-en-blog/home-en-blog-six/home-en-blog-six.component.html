                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Igor Arapov. Today we will continue discussing the <strong class="orange">Smart
                            Money</strong>
                        concept. In previous posts, we looked at examples where <strong class="orange">Smart
                            Money</strong> was buying
                        assets. Today, we will look at a case where <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> was
                        selling.</p>

                    <p><strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> often manipulates the market to shake out
                        participants and gather
                        liquidity. When we analyze volumes, it is important to see if this volume touches any level.</p>

                    <p>If you look at the chart in my video <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/oT8aVcWI2Oo?si=XlqMByAIzhVQ_sul">https://youtu.be/oT8aVcWI2Oo?si=XlqMByAIzhVQ_sul</a>,
                        you can see that the price was rising. I was trading at that time and remember that there was
                        important news.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Tip</h3>
                    <p>Pay attention to key news. It always triggers high activity in the market, which is visible in
                        volumes. News usually
                        changes the perception of value in the market, affecting price and volumes.</p>

                    <p>According to <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> logic, to sell, you need to do it where
                        there is no demand.
                        A market drop is always associated with a drop in demand. In our example, in the zone with high
                        volumes during the
                        news, there was a false rise, after which the price fell. The next four-hour bar shows that
                        there is no support in
                        the market, and <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> is not interested. This is the
                        beginning of the
                        distribution phase; then, the distribution phase ends, and the trend phase begins.</p>

                    <p>This is an example according to <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> logic, but for
                        selling. The principles
                        are the same: a zone with liquidity, its absence, and a trend change.</p>
