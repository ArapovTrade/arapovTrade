                            better?</span>
                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! Today we will talk about trading and investing. These two concepts are often
                        confused, and I want to
                        help you understand the difference and not get confused when choosing your path. My name is Igor
                        Arapov, I have been
                        trading for over 11 years, and I will share my experience.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">The Difference Between Trading and Investing</h3>
                    <p>Let's start with the S&P 500 index, which has shown almost parabolic growth since 2008. The
                        question is: by buying
                        this index, are you investing or speculating? A trader makes money by buying cheaper and selling
                        higher. An
                        investor, however, earns not only from the growth but also from dividends when buying stocks.
                    </p>

                    <p>Although trading and investing may look the same on a chart, they are different things. For
                        example, if you compare
                        the S&P 500 chart with the Bitcoin chart, both show explosive growth. But can you earn on
                        Bitcoin as an investor?
                        Hardly, because Bitcoin does not produce anything.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Classic Investing</h3>
                    <p>Classic investing involves buying assets that create added value, such as factories and plants.
                        These assets work,
                        produce goods, and their owners receive profits in the form of dividends. An investor focuses
                        more on stable income
                        rather than selling the asset.</p>

                    <p>There is no such model in trading. A trader buys an asset without added value and makes money
                        only on price
                        differences. If the market does not rise or fall, the trader loses money. An investor, on the
                        other hand, earns
                        income from the operation of the asset, regardless of its market price.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Investor vs. Speculator</h3>
                    <p>An investor does not wait for speculative profit. If you buy cryptocurrencies hoping for rapid
                        growth, you are not an
                        investor but a speculator. Investing is aimed at preserving and increasing capital, protecting
                        it from inflation.
                    </p>

                    <p>In the West, people actively invest to protect their money from inflation and earn income. A bank
                        deposit does not
                        cope with this task and carries bankruptcy risks. The stock market can bring stable income if
                        you trust monetary
                        policy.</p>

                    <p>During the pandemic, the Fed supported the market by printing money and buying bonds. But you
                        cannot print money
                        endlessly because it leads to inflation. I hope this article will be useful for beginners. It
                        will help you
                        understand whether you want to become a long-term investor or a trader.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Short-term and Long-term Strategies</h3>
                    <p>In trading, it is important to stay up-to-date with the latest events and forecast the market in
                        the short term.
                        Which field to choose is up to you, based on your goals and preferences.</p>
