      <strong>What is the difference between a trader and an investor</strong> — one of
      the most common questions for those just entering the world of finance.
      A trader actively buys and sells assets in short timeframes, earning
      from price fluctuations ranging from minutes to weeks. An investor
      allocates money for months, years, or decades, counting on asset
      appreciation or passive income. A trader constantly monitors charts,
      news, and indicators. An investor analyzes fundamental company metrics,
      the economy, and dividend policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Key differences: a trader uses technical analysis, support and
      resistance levels, candlestick patterns. An investor studies balance
      sheets, P/E, ROE, cash flows. A trader works with leverage, margin,
      stop-losses. An investor prefers diversification, ETFs, bonds, real
      estate. A trader needs high involvement, an investor — patience and
      strategic thinking.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Trader: short-term trades, high risk, daily monitoring.
      </li>
      <li>
        Investor: long-term investments, moderate risk, infrequent
        operations.
      </li>
      <li>
        Trader profits from volatility, investor — from market growth.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      How does a trader differ from an investor in lifestyle? A trader lives
      by the market rhythm, often trading at night (Forex, crypto),
      experiencing stress from losses. An investor checks the portfolio once
      a quarter, independent of daily swings. Many combine both: part of the
      capital in trading, part in investing.

    <h2>Who is a trader?</h2>
    <p>
      Who is a trader? A person who earns by buying and selling financial
      instruments: currencies, stocks, cryptocurrencies, futures, CFDs. A
      trader opens dozens or hundreds of trades per month using scalping,
      intraday, or swing trading. How to become a trader from scratch? Start
      by choosing a broker, opening a demo account, learning a platform like
      MetaTrader or TradingView.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can become a trader? Anyone with a computer, internet, and starting
      capital from $100. But success comes to disciplined, analytical,
      stress-resistant people. A trader must read charts, identify trends,
      use RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands. Risk management skills are mandatory:
      no more than 1–2% of the deposit per trade.
    </p>
    <h2>How to become a trader from scratch?</h2>

        start with what interests you.

      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Practice on a demo account:</strong> at least 3 months to
        master the platform and test strategies without risk.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Keep a trading journal:</strong> record entries, exits,
        reasons, emotions — this helps analyze and improve results.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Develop a strategy:</strong> trend-following, breakout,
        pullback — choose an approach, test, and adapt it to yourself.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Switch to a real account:</strong> start with a small amount,
        follow risk management, and don’t rush.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>A trader</strong> is a profession requiring constant learning.
      Markets change, new instruments and regulations appear. A successful
      trader spends 2–8 hours a day on analysis, news, strategy testing, and
      skill development.

    <h2>How to start trading as a beginner</h2>
    <p>
      How to start trading as a beginner? The first step is to understand if
      active trading suits you. If yes — choose a licensed broker with low
      spreads and a demo account. Learn basic terms: lot, pip, spread, swap,
      margin call. Master the platform: installing indicators, drawing trend
      lines, setting alerts.
    </p>
    <p>How to start trading as a beginner in practice:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Open a demo account with $10,000 virtual dollars.</li>
      <li>
        Select 2–3 currency pairs (EUR/USD, GBP/USD) or stocks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Study timeframes: M1, M5 for scalping; H1, H4 for intraday.
      </li>
      <li>Learn to set stop-loss and take-profit.</li>
      <li>
        Follow the economic calendar: NFP, Fed rates, GDP.
      </li>
      <li>
        Test one strategy for at least 100 trades on demo.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      How to start trading as a beginner without losses? Never switch to a
      real account until you show consistent profit on demo for 3 consecutive
      months. Start with micro-lots, risking no more than 1% per trade. Keep
      statistics: win rate, profit factor, drawdown.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beginners often make mistakes: overtrading, ignoring stops, revenge
      trading. Avoid this — follow the plan. Trading is not gambling, it’s a
      system.
    </p>

    <h2>Who is an investor</h2>
    <p>
      Who is an investor? A person who invests money in assets for the long
      term to earn from appreciation or dividends. An investor buys stocks,
      bonds, ETFs, mutual funds, real estate. Does not trade daily — builds a
      portfolio and rebalances 1–2 times a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      How to become an investor? Open a brokerage account or IIS. Define
      goals: save for retirement, apartment, children’s education. Study
      fundamental analysis: revenue, profit, company debt, dividend yield.
    </p>
    <h3>How to start investing:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Assess risk profile: conservative, moderate, aggressive.
      </li>
      <li>
        Build an emergency fund for 6 months of expenses.
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose a strategy: buy and hold, DCA, dividend stocks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Buy first assets: ETF on S&P 500, OFZ bonds, blue-chip stocks.
      </li>
      <li>Set up automatic monthly account top-ups.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      An investor differs from a trader in passivity. No need to watch charts
      — just read company reports and economic news once a week.
    </p>

    <h2>Advantages of trading</h2>
    <p>
      Advantages of trading: high potential returns, liquidity, flexibility.
      A trader can earn 50–100% per year with the right strategy. Uses
      leverage 1:10, 1:100 to amplify results. Withdraws profit daily.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Access to 24/7 markets (crypto, Forex).</li>
      <li>
        Wide range of instruments: currencies, indices, commodities.
      </li>
      <li>Fast order execution.</li>
      <li>Earn on both rising and falling prices.</li>
      <li>Develops analytical skills, discipline.</li>
      <li>Start with $10–100.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Trading suits those who love dynamics, are ready to learn, and can
      control emotions. Professionals combine it with work, trading in the
      evening or morning.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Disadvantages of trading</h2>
    <p>
      Disadvantages of trading: high risk, stress, time commitment. 70–80% of
      beginners lose their deposit in the first year. Leverage amplifies
      losses. Volatility can wipe out an account in a day.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Emotional burnout.</li>
      <li>3–8 hours a day on analysis.</li>
      <li>Constant learning of new strategies.</li>
      <li>Commissions, spreads, swaps eat into profit.</li>
      <li>Risk of margin call.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Trading requires iron discipline. Without a plan and risk management —
      it’s a lottery.

  <section>
    <h2>Advantages of investing</h2>
    <p>
      Advantages of investing: stability, passive income, compound interest.
      Average stock return — 8–12% annually. Dividends 2–6%. ETFs with 0.03%
      fee.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Diversification reduces risks.</li>
      <li>No daily involvement needed.</li>
      <li>Protection against inflation.</li>
      <li>Capital growth over time.</li>
      <li>Tax benefits (IIS).</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Investing suits busy people who want to grow capital without stress.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Disadvantages of investing</h2>
    <p>
      Disadvantages of investing: slow growth, starting capital, crises.
      Money is locked for years. Inflation, taxes, sanctions affect returns.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Waiting 5–10 years for significant results.</li>
      <li>Market drops of 20–50%.</li>
      <li>Dependence on macroeconomics.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Can you combine trading and investing</h2>
    <p>
      Investor-trader — does it exist? Yes, professionals split capital:
      70–80% into long-term investments (ETFs, stocks, bonds), 20–30% into
      active trading. This balances risk and return. Investing provides the
      base, trading — extra profit.
    </p>
    <p>How to become an investor-trader:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Open two accounts: one for investing, one for trading.
      </li>
      <li>Invest regular amounts (DCA).</li>
      <li>Trade only with free capital.</li>
      <li>
        Don’t touch the long-term portfolio during drawdowns.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Combining gives flexibility: stability + high return potential.
    </p>

    <h2>Which is more profitable: trader or investor</h2>
    <p>
      Which is more profitable: trader or investor? A trader can earn
      50–200% per year but risks losing everything. An investor gets 8–15%
      steadily, with drawdowns up to 30%. Statistically, 90% of traders are
      in the red, 80% of investors are in profit after 10 years.
    </p>
    <p>What is more profitable:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Trading — for experienced, with capital and time.</li>
      <li>Investing — for beginners, busy, conservative people.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Most experts recommend: 90% of capital in investing, 10% in trading
      for learning.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>What to choose — trading or investing?</h2>
    <p>
      The choice between trading and investing is a matter of your goals,
      character, and resources. Both approaches can lead to financial
      success but require different mindsets and preparation.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Trading:</strong> Choose if you are energetic, love risk, and
        are ready to spend hours analyzing the market. This path is for those
        who want quick results and aren’t afraid of losses. Start with a demo
        account, master basic strategies (e.g., trend trading), and strictly
        follow risk management.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Investing:</strong> Suitable for patient, strategically
        thinking people who value stability and don’t want daily stress.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The main thing is knowledge and discipline. Study the basics (books,
      courses, YouTube), experiment with small amounts, and don’t chase
      “easy money.” Trading and investing are a marathon, not a sprint. Find
      your path, and financial independence will become reality!
