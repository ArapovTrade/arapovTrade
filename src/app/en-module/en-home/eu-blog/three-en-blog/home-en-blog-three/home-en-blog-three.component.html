                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello, friends! I'm Igor Arapov, and today we will talk about market <span
                            class="orange">volatility</span>. What is volatility, how to use it,
                        and why we need <span class="orange">the ATR (Average True Range) indicator</span>.</p>

                    <p>First, it's important to understand that there is always volatility in the market. It can be low,
                        medium, or high. In
                        one day, the market can move 10, 40, or even 100 points. This indicator constantly changes, and
                        this is exactly what
                        traders earn from. Without volatility, when the market is stagnant, trading is impossible.</p>

                    <p>The market has phases: expansion and contraction. For example, at the beginning of the European
                        session, when the
                        price contracts like a spring, a false breakout often occurs, which can be a signal for action.
                    </p>

                    <p>Market volatility constantly alternates: first comes contraction, then expansion, and so on. This
                        is the immutable
                        mechanics of the market.</p>

                    <p>So, if we understand this, we can use the ATR indicator over 14 bars. This indicator measures the
                        average range of
                        market movement, showing how volatile or calm the market is. At these extreme values, you can
                        fix your trades.</p>

                    <p>ATR does not predict a reversal, but it shows when the market has reached its peak volatility.
                        When the indicator
                        shows a high value, it means the market has been moving in one direction for a long time and may
                        soon stop or
                        correct.</p>

                    <p>Any trend trader should know this indicator to exit the market in time before a correction.
                        Otherwise, all profits
                        can be lost.</p>

                    <p>ATR calculates its values simply. It takes the last 14 bars, sums their highs and lows, and
                        divides by 14 to get the
                        average value. If the indicator shows high values, be ready to exit the market.</p>

                    <p>That's all you need to know about volatility and the ATR indicator.</p>
