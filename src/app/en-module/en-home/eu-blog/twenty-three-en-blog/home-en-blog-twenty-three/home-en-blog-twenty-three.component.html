                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov. Today I will tell you about levels and the concept of
                        <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong>. Levels show value, and everything you want to trade
                        using volume analysis
                        needs to be found at levels. Big money and banks always buy low and sell high, and we see this
                        through volumes.
                        Therefore, it is important to be able to identify these levels and use volume analysis to see
                        when <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> is active in the market and to use this
                        information to your advantage.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Actions of Smart Money</h3>
                    <p><strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> always buys when the market is falling. They increase
                        the supply to buy.
                        For example, when the price falls below the minimum level, it knocks out buyers and activates
                        stop-losses. Traders
                        who trade on a level breakout enter short positions, which allows professionals to place limit
                        orders and accumulate
                        positions.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Accumulation Phases</h3>
                    <p>How to determine the beginning and end of the accumulation phase? The beginning of the phase is
                        very high volume when
                        they are actively buying. The end of the phase is when bearish liquidity runs out, and they have
                        no choice but to
                        buy at the market. At this point, there is no liquidity, and the price begins to rise.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Market Direction Change</h3>
                    <p>When you see low volume in a high volume zone, be prepared for the market to change direction.
                        These situations often
                        occur on news because news explains why the market is moving. If the news is bad, expect a local
                        trend until
                        professionals reach their goal and lock in profits. They sell just as they bought: buying from
                        someone and selling
                        to someone. Buying from the crowd at lows and selling at highs, they make a profit, while
                        uninformed participants
                        incur losses.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>Levels are a key tool in technical analysis. There are always manipulations at levels aimed at
                        misleading uninformed
                        participants, knocking out stop-losses, and then developing a trend. Experienced traders wait
                        for such situations at
                        levels and then join the new movement.</p>
