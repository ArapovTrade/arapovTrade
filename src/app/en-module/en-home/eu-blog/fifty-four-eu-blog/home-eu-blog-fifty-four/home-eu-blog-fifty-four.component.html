                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today we will continue our discussion on <strong
                            class="orange">cryptocurrencies</strong>. Today, I want to talk about the unique aspects of
                        the cryptocurrency
                        market compared to other markets.</p>

                    <p>The first thing I want to highlight is the profitability of the cryptocurrency market, which is
                        its volatility. The
                        price of a coin can increase by hundreds or even thousands of percent in a day, especially if
                        it's a meme coin. This
                        doesn't happen in regular regulated markets. This volatility scares conservative investors but
                        attracts those who
                        enjoy taking risks, much like in a casino, hoping to get rich quickly. But that's not our focus
                        today. Today, we'll
                        discuss three key aspects of the cryptocurrency market, particularly Bitcoin: <strong
                            class="orange">liquidity</strong>, <strong class="orange">volatility</strong>, and <strong
                            class="orange">market
                            capitalization</strong>. We'll talk about what they mean and why it's important to
                        understand them.</p>

                    <p>First, let's look at the <strong class="orange">order book</strong>. Here, you can see that
                        trading volumes on the
                        market are low. Today is Sunday, but on any other day, the volumes will be about the same. Maybe
                        slightly more or
                        slightly less, but overall, these are small volumes. We won't consider iceberg orders — these
                        are <strong class="orange">algorithmic orders</strong> that hide their full size. All of this is
                        done by robots, not humans.
                        We only take into account the numbers we see.</p>

                    <p>These numbers indicate that the market is <strong class="orange">illiquid</strong>. An illiquid
                        market means that you
                        can't buy or sell large amounts without affecting the price. Money on such a market will
                        inevitably impact the
                        price. This is a significant problem for large capital and one of the reasons why big money is
                        cautious about
                        entering the cryptocurrency market. No one wants the price to move against them. Large banks
                        have already bought
                        Bitcoin during sell-offs because smart money always buys during a market sell-off. But if you
                        look at the situation
                        separately, you can see that the market is thin, meaning it's illiquid. This is the key reason
                        for <strong class="orange">volatility</strong>. Volatility depends on liquidity. The market's
                        <strong class="orange">capitalization</strong> is relatively small compared to the stock market
                        and other conservative
                        markets. So it all makes sense here: no liquidity — expect volatility.
                    </p>

                    <p>Now let's talk about <strong class="orange">market capitalization</strong>. Capitalization is
                        calculated simply: the
                        number of coins is multiplied by the current price. If the market is illiquid, it means that
                        large volumes can't be
                        sold or bought without changing the price. Market capitalization is very conditional. In the
                        <strong class="orange">order book</strong>, small portions of coins are traded. The price is
                        just the last completed
                        transaction. Volumes show how much can realistically be bought and sold, and when they are low,
                        it is a problem for
                        the market. That's why large capital buys assets during sell-offs to create conditions for price
                        growth and attract
                        as many participants as possible to join the bull trend. The buying demand driven by news and
                        greed allows large
                        players to sell without significantly changing the price against their sales.
                    </p>

                    <p>The market has phases of <strong class="orange">accumulation</strong> by large capital and
                        <strong class="orange">distribution</strong>. If you are not familiar with them, watch my videos
                        on volume analysis of
                        the market. It's important to understand that on a thin market, professionals will try to lure
                        in as many
                        participants as possible to sell their positions. Until they do this, you can be confident in
                        the continuation of
                        the bull trend because you can't sell much on such a market without changing the price. Certain
                        conditions need to
                        be created, which is what large players do to sell their assets. Knowing this, you can
                        comfortably work between the
                        phases of accumulation and distribution, enjoying the volatility.
                    </p>
