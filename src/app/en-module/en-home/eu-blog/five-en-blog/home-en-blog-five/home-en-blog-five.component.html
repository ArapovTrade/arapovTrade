                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! Today I will talk about how prices are formed in the market and what liquidity
                        problems large players
                        face.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">To begin with</h3>
                    <p>The price in any market is determined by two indicators: the bid price and the ask price (or
                        offer). The bid price
                        shows how much buyers are willing to pay, while the ask price shows how much sellers are willing
                        to sell without
                        affecting the price. We are currently considering an example with Ethereum.</p>

                    <p>The higher the price, the more liquidity in the market, and the lower the price, the more buyers
                        are willing to buy.
                    </p>

                    <p>Now I want to define a very important term:</p>
                    <p><span class="orange">Spread</span> is a very important component of supply and demand. The
                        difference between buyers
                        and sellers, defined as the spread, is usually a criterion of liquidity. The wider the spread,
                        the harder it is to
                        execute trades in the market, and the narrower the spread, the easier it is for buyers and
                        sellers to find their
                        counterparties.</p>

                    <p>From this, we can conclude: if the spread, the difference between bid and ask, increases, it
                        becomes harder to
                        execute trades in the market. The smaller the spread, the easier it is for buyers and sellers to
                        find each other.
                    </p>

                    <p>If we stretch the spread wider and build it along the market extremes, we will see that there is
                        a price where
                        sellers are actively selling and a price where buyers are actively buying. Problems for large
                        players arise when
                        they consider an asset very cheap and want to buy, but liquidity runs out, and they have to buy
                        at market prices.
                        Conversely, when the asset is expensive, they want to sell, but there is no one to sell to, and
                        the price falls.</p>

                    <p>The price in the market moves from one level to another, from cheap to expensive and vice versa.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Market Manipulations</h3>
                    <p>Market manipulations are often related to finding liquidity. Large players who bought coins at a
                        low price want to
                        sell them for a profit. But the volumes they have accumulated are hard to realize because there
                        are no buyers at
                        high levels. Manipulations look like sharp price movements, often during news events. This is
                        done to draw small
                        traders into the market and use their liquidity to fix profits. After this, the market often
                        becomes bearish.</p>

                    <p>This point needs to be understood when trading levels, especially in markets with extremely low
                        liquidity. Now, in
                        the bear market, we can see that the Ethereum market is very unclaimed, the demand for it is
                        very low. Those who buy
                        at the lows face great difficulties in realizing their profits. Therefore, before selling, it is
                        advisable to wait
                        for manipulation by those who are holding buys. When they realize their profits and the market
                        shows that demand is
                        flooded, it can be confidently shorted. This is just a hypothetical example that can arise in
                        one of these markets.
