                    </h1>


                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov and today we will talk about market makers, or limit
                        players in the market.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Who is a Market Maker?</h3>
                    <p>A market maker is a mysterious market participant who often scares traders. Many blame him for
                        their failures because
                        they do not understand what he is doing. Today we will figure out who is to blame for traders'
                        problems and how to
                        solve them.</p>

                    <p>First of all, I want to say that a market maker is primarily a limit participant in the market.
                        He himself is, of
                        course, a professional market participant simply because he has algorithms, technologies, and
                        money on his side.
                        And, of course, he is no competition for a retail trader. In other words, he is an informed
                        professional market
                        participant. This is the first point. Second, he maintains liquidity in the market by signing a
                        contract with the
                        exchange. This means that he helps stabilize prices, preventing them from fluctuating sharply.
                        This is his main
                        task.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Two Types of Market Participants</h3>
                    <p>There are two types of participants in the market: those who move the price with market orders,
                        and those who place
                        limit orders. A limit order is an order placed at a specific price, waiting for a counter order.
                        Limit orders are
                        usually placed by professionals because they want to open a position at a favorable price. For
                        example, on the euro
                        chart, you can see how the price falls from the limit level. This means that the limit seller
                        held the price from
                        rising. By analyzing the trading volumes, you can understand where the limit players are and how
                        they influence the
                        price.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Traders' Problems</h3>
                    <p>For a trader, it is not so important who is behind the limit orders; the main thing is to
                        understand that these are
                        rational market participants. Traders' problems are often related to the fact that they take
                        irrational actions. For
                        example, they buy at resistance levels and sell at support levels, which leads to losses.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">The Role of a Market Maker</h3>
                    <p>A market maker helps stabilize the market, and without him, there would be more volatility. He
                        approaches trading
                        rationally, like any professional. To trade successfully, it is important to learn to understand
                        the levels on the
                        chart where the price is cheap or expensive. This will help make profitable trades.</p>
