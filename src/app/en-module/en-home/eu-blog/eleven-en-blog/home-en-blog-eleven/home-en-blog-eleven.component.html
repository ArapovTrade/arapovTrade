                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today I want to share important information about the
                        starting deposit
                        with beginner traders. Over 11 years of trading, I have seen many situations, especially in the
                        cryptocurrency
                        market, where beginners get lost due to a lack of understanding of this field. In this post, I
                        will try to explain
                        in more detail how to start correctly and avoid mistakes.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Your Deposit is Your Business</h3>
                    <p>It is important to understand that your deposit is your business. Everything you earn or lose is
                        part of your work
                        for yourself. Many beginners do not achieve success on the first try, and that is normal. Just
                        like in any other
                        business, it takes time to understand and become a professional in trading.</p>

                    <p>The foundation of success in trading is understanding the market and knowing how to trade
                        correctly. It does not
                        matter what size your deposit is if you do not know when to buy and when to sell. Many beginners
                        try to buy low and
                        sell high but often do the opposite, leading to losses.</p>

                    <p>For experienced traders, the size of the deposit is important because it directly affects
                        profitability. The average
                        conservative profitability ranges from 2 to 5% per month. However, these rules do not apply to
                        beginners. Even with
                        a large deposit, if you do not understand how to work in the market, you risk losing your funds.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Advice for Beginner Traders</h3>
                    <p>My advice for beginner traders is not to focus immediately on the size of the deposit. Start with
                        a small amount,
                        make systematic and thoughtful trades, and only then draw conclusions about what deposit size
                        you need.</p>

                    <p>Remember that in trading, it is important not only to earn but also to manage risks. This is a
                        business, not a game
                        of chance. Gradually study trading, gain experience with small accounts, and when you are
                        confident in your
                        abilities, then you can consider increasing your deposit.</p>
