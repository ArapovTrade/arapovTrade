                    is one of the most popular and versatile technical analysis
                    indicators, developed by American financial analyst John
                    Bollinger in the early 1980s. The indicator measures market
                    volatility and determines relative overbought and oversold
                    levels.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The uniqueness of Bollinger Bands lies in their
                    adaptability: unlike static indicators, they automatically
                    expand during volatility increases and contract during
                    decreases. This makes them an effective tool for any market
                    conditions — from calm consolidations to powerful trending
                    movements.

                    is a simple moving average (SMA), typically with period 20.
                    It reflects the average price over the selected period and
                    serves as the base for calculating other components.

                    is calculated as the middle line plus two standard
                    deviations: Upper Band = SMA(20) + 2 × StdDev. The

                  <p>
                    Standard deviation is a statistical measure showing price
                    dispersion relative to the average value. With default
                    settings, approximately 95% of price movements fall between
                    the upper and lower bands. Moves beyond the bands are
                    statistically rare and signal extreme conditions.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Standard parameters — period 20 and deviation multiplier 2 —
                    are recommended by John Bollinger himself and suit most
                    markets and timeframes. These settings provide balance
                    between indicator sensitivity and signal reliability.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For short-term trading and scalping, reduced period of 10 or
                    12 is used. This makes bands more sensitive to price
                    changes, generating more signals. However, false triggers
                    increase, requiring additional filtering.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    For position trading, increased period of 50 or even 200 is
                    applied. Such settings smooth short-term noise and show more
                    significant levels. Deviation multiplier of 2.5 or 3 creates
                    wider channel with rare but more reliable signals on band
                    touches.

                    is one of the most important Bollinger Bands states. It
                    occurs when
                    <a
                      class="linkrefinto"

                    >
                    drops to minimum values, and bands narrow, forming a tight
                    corridor around price.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Squeeze is a period of market energy accumulation. Like a
                    compressed spring, the market prepares for a sharp movement.
                    Statistically, a period of low volatility is followed by
                    high volatility. Traders use squeeze to prepare for entry in
                    the direction of the future breakout.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Important to understand: squeeze doesn't predict movement
                    direction, only the fact of upcoming impulse. Additional
                    tools are needed to determine direction: trend analysis on
                    higher timeframe, volumes, other indicators, or Price Action
                    patterns.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Squeeze identification can be done visually or through the
                    Bollinger Band Width indicator. Minimum width values over
                    the past 6 months or year indicate significant squeeze with
                    high potential for subsequent movement.

                  <p>
                    Band expansion occurs during volatility growth and usually
                    accompanies trending movements. After breaking out from
                    squeeze, bands quickly diverge, visually confirming impulse
                    start. The stronger the expansion, the more powerful the
                    current movement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a strong uptrend, price moves in the upper half of the
                    channel, periodically touching or breaking through the upper
                    band. This phenomenon is called "Walking the Band" and
                    indicates sustained bullish momentum. Attempting to short on
                    upper band touch in such conditions is unprofitable.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Similarly, in a downtrend, price stays in the lower half of
                    the channel. Lower band touches are not a buy signal but
                    confirmation of bear strength. Only price exit into the
                    upper half of the channel with middle line breakout signals
                    weakening seller pressure.

                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    The Bollinger Bands middle line is the
                    <a
                      class="linkrefinto"

                      >moving average</a
                    >
                    SMA(20), acting as dynamic support or resistance level. In
                    an uptrend, pullbacks often end at the middle line,
                    providing opportunities for long entry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a downtrend, the middle line works as resistance. Rally
                    attempts are rejected from it, and price returns to downward
                    movement. Middle line breakout with consolidation is the
                    first sign of potential trend change or deeper correction
                    beginning.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In a sideways market, price fluctuates around the middle
                    line without clear direction. Middle line crossings have no
                    special significance in such conditions. Traders wait for
                    consolidation exit with band expansion to determine new
                    direction.
                  </p>

                    <span itemprop="name">Bounce Strategy</span>
                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    The bounce strategy works in sideways markets and
                    consolidations. The principle is simple: buy on lower band
                    touch, sell on upper band touch. Target is the opposite band
                    or middle line. Stop-loss is placed beyond the band with
                    buffer.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Critically important to apply this strategy only in
                    appropriate market conditions. In a trending market, buying
                    at the lower band in a downward movement will lead to a
                    series of losses. Confirming absence of pronounced trend is
                    necessary before using the strategy.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Additional filters improve strategy effectiveness: reversal
                    candlestick patterns on band touch, oscillator divergences,
                    volume reaction. Entry is executed not on the touch itself
                    but after confirming signal appears.

                  </h2>
                  <p>
                    Breakout strategy applies after band squeeze. Trader waits
                    for price exit beyond the narrowed channel and enters in
                    breakout direction. This is a momentum strategy based on
                    impulse movement continuation.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Breakout confirmation includes: candle close beyond the
                    band, volume increase, band expansion. False breakouts are
                    common, so many traders wait for retest of the broken band
                    before entry.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Stop-loss is set on the opposite side of squeeze or beyond
                    the middle line. Targets are determined by support and
                    resistance levels , Fibonacci extensions, or fixed
                    risk-to-reward ratio.

                    John Bollinger developed a specific methodology for
                    identifying reversal patterns using his indicator. M-Top
                    (double top) and W-Bottom (double bottom) patterns gain
                    additional significance in the context of the bands.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Classic W-Bottom: first low touches or breaks the lower
                    band, second low is higher than the first and stays inside
                    the bands. This indicates weakening bearish pressure and
                    potential upward reversal. Intermediate high breakout
                    confirms the pattern.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    M-Top forms mirror-like: first high touches the upper band,
                    second high is lower and stays inside the channel. Bullish
                    momentum weakens despite attempt to make new high.
                    Intermediate low breakout activates the bearish scenario.

                  <p>
                    Bollinger Bands effectively combine with oscillators. RSI
                    helps determine if band touch is a true extreme. Lower band
                    touch with RSI below 30 is a stronger oversold signal than
                    touch with RSI in neutral zone.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Combination with MACD adds a trend filter. Buy signals from
                    Bollinger Bands in ranging market are accepted only with
                    positive MACD histogram or bullish crossover. This reduces
                    probability of entering against forming trend. I also
                    recommend studying the

                    Pairing with Stochastic is especially useful for bounce
                    strategy. Band touch with oversold/overbought Stochastic
                    turning around is a high-probability entry point. Stochastic
                    divergences at bands strengthen the signal.

                    Multi-timeframe analysis improves trading decision quality.
                    On weekly chart, bands show long-term volatility boundaries
                    and key zones. Squeeze on weekly timeframe precedes

                    Daily chart is the main working tool for most traders. Band
                    signals here have good balance between frequency and
                    reliability. Daily chart squeezes indicate upcoming
                    movements lasting from several days to weeks.

                    Intraday timeframes require caution. False signals increase,
                    especially on minute charts. Effective approach: use higher
                    timeframe for direction determination, lower for precise
                    entry on band touch.

                    Cryptocurrency markets are characterized by heightened
                    volatility, affecting indicator behavior. Standard settings
                    may give too many band touches. Increasing multiplier to 2.5
                    or 3 adapts indicator to crypto market specifics.

                  <p>
                    Squeezes on cryptocurrencies often precede extreme
                    movements. Breakout after prolonged squeeze on Bitcoin or
                    altcoins can lead to movement of tens of percent. This
                    creates excellent opportunities for trend trading.

                  <p>
                    Bounce strategy on cryptocurrencies requires special
                    caution. High volatility means price can break through band
                    and continue movement without reversal. Strict stop-losses
                    are mandatory for capital protection.

                    The main mistake is perceiving band touch as automatic entry
                    signal. Upper band touch doesn't mean you should sell, lower
                    band touch doesn't mean you should buy. In a trend, price

                  <p>
                    Ignoring market context leads to losses. Bounce strategy in
                    trending market, breakout strategy in ranging market —

                    In the context of Smart Money concept, Bollinger Bands
                    squeeze often corresponds to accumulation or distribution
                    phases. Large players build positions during low volatility
                    periods before initiating movement.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    False band breakouts can be used by Smart Money for
                    liquidity grabbing. Price exits beyond band, triggers retail
                    trader stop-losses, then sharply reverses. Understanding
                    this mechanics helps avoid traps.

                  <p>
                    Band expansion after squeeze with high volume indicates

                    Percent B (%B) is a derivative indicator showing price
                    position relative to bands. Value 0 means price is at lower
                    band, 1 at upper band, 0.5 at middle line. Values above 1 or
                    below 0 indicate exit beyond bands.

                  <p>
                    %B is useful for quantitative assessment of price position
                    in channel. Traders can create rules based on specific
                    values: for example, buy when %B below 0.1, sell when %B
                    above 0.9. This adds objectivity to decision making.

                    Bollinger Bands help objectify price perception. Visual
                    channel boundaries show whether current price is relatively
                    high or low compared to recent history. This reduces
                    emotional trading decisions.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    However, FOMO can arise when watching breakouts. Trader sees
                    sharp movement after squeeze and enters late, when
                    significant part of impulse is already realized. Disciplined

                    Patience during squeeze is crucial quality. Consolidation
                    can continue long, provoking premature entries. Clear
                    breakout criteria and willingness to miss first movement in

                        Bollinger Bands is a volatility indicator consisting of
                        three lines: the middle band (SMA 20), upper and lower
                        bands positioned two standard deviations from the
                        middle. Developed by John Bollinger in the 1980s.
