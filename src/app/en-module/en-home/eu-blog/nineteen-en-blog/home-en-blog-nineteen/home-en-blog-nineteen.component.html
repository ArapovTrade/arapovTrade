                    <p>Hello! My name is Igor Arapov. If you are reading this article, it means you are interested in
                        trading. The main idea
                        of this article is that a successful trader must be able to analyze the market and especially
                        the trades of <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong>.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">What is Smart Money?</h3>
                    <p><strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> are large financial institutions that play a
                        significant role in the
                        market. They buy when prices are low, often visible by huge trading volumes. When prices are
                        high, they tend to
                        sell, which is also reflected in their trading volumes. For a retail trader, it is very
                        beneficial to learn to
                        recognize the levels that interest these large players and be able to align with their
                        strategies.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Market Liquidity</h3>
                    <p>On my channel, you will find many videos about market liquidity â€” what it is, how it affects
                        trading, and why big
                        players limit it. I also cover technical analysis in detail, including working with levels,
                        false breakouts,
                        candlesticks, patterns, and indicators. All this will help you confidently develop as a trader
                        and apply your
                        knowledge in practice.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Demand and Supply Analysis</h3>
                    <p>Trading with smart players requires the ability to analyze demand and supply. This is why volume
                        analysis is so
                        important and effective. Financial markets are filled with many experienced participants, and
                        success in trading
                        often depends on the ability to follow their example.</p>
