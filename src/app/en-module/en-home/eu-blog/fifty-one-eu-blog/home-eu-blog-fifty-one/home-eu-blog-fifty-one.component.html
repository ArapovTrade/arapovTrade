                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov. Today, I want to talk about <strong class="orange">Price
                            Action</strong> patterns,
                        specifically about <strong class="orange">bullish</strong> and <strong class="orange">bearish
                            engulfing</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>This article is intended for beginners, as technical analysis <strong class="orange">“Price
                            Action”</strong> is very
                        popular among novice traders. Unlike fundamental analysis or <strong class="orange">“Smart
                            Money”</strong> analysis,
                        most beginners start with <strong class="orange">“Price Action”</strong>. Therefore, in this
                        video, we will discuss
                        the pros and cons of <strong class="orange">“Price Action”</strong>, why I don't use it, and
                        what beginners need to
                        understand.</p>

                    <p>To start with, <strong class="orange">“Price Action”</strong> is about price patterns. We need to
                        find certain
                        formations on the chart and use them. Using the euro-dollar example, I drew two levels. These
                        levels form a range.
                        At the lower boundary, there was a <strong class="orange">bullish engulfing</strong> pattern
                        three times.</p>

                    <p>A <strong class="orange">“bullish engulfing”</strong> pattern consists of two bars. The first bar
                        is <strong class="orange">bearish</strong>, and the second bar is <strong
                            class="orange">bullish</strong>, fully covering
                        the body of the first bar. For example, a small down bar followed by a bullish candle with a
                        higher close. This is a
                        <strong class="orange">bullish engulfing</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>A <strong class="orange">“bearish engulfing”</strong> is the opposite: a <strong
                            class="orange">bullish</strong>
                        candle followed by a <strong class="orange">bearish</strong> candle that closes lower. These
                        patterns by themselves
                        mean little because within the range, you can see both <strong class="orange">bullish</strong>
                        and <strong class="orange">bearish engulfing</strong>. If you react to every pattern, you might
                        get tired of constantly
                        exiting and re-entering positions.</p>

                    <p>However, these patterns matter at levels. Why? In volume analysis, I have already mentioned that
                        <strong class="orange">volume</strong> is a reaction to price. Participants see ranges and
                        levels where the price cannot
                        break through several times. This creates a desire to buy at these levels because they consider
                        this price to be the
                        cheapest on the market.
                    </p>

                    <p>A <strong class="orange">“bullish engulfing”</strong> pattern at a level can lead to a strong
                        <strong class="orange">bullish</strong> movement because there is participant interest, and
                        orders are executed. The
                        price bounces off the level where there is no supply, meaning buyers are forced to push the
                        price higher.
                    </p>

                    <p>This is an example of the logic behind <strong class="orange">“Price Action”</strong> that you
                        need to use and
                        understand. But don't use it in isolation from levels; otherwise, there will be significant
                        problems.</p>
