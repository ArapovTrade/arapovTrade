                                Price Action is a market analysis method focusing exclusively on price movement without
                                using indicators. It
                                is a powerful tool for understanding market sentiment and making trading decisions. In
                                this guide, we will
                                delve into the core principles of Price Action, popular patterns, strategies, and
                                practical applications.

                            <h2>What is Price Action?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Price Action is a chart analysis technique based on studying historical price movement.
                                This approach allows
                                traders to focus on pure price data without distractions from indicators. The main idea
                                is that all
                                information necessary for trading is already reflected in the price movement.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> No need for complex indicators or mathematical
                                    calculations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Suitable for all markets and timeframes.</li>
                                <li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Helps quickly respond to market changes.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Key Elements of Price Action</h2>
                            <p>
                                Price Action analysis uses key chart elements such as support and resistance levels,
                                candlestick patterns,
                                and trends. These elements form the foundation for making trading decisions.
                            </p>
