                    </h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov and today we will talk about support and resistance
                        levels: how to build,
                        identify, and most importantly, how to use them.</p>

                    <p>When you work in a range, remember that the support level is not just a line, but a whole range.
                        The price will move
                        within these ranges. On the chart, I draw two lines: one indicates the level, and the other
                        shows that the price can
                        go beyond it. You can see the detailed chart in the <a class="orange dec"
                            href="https://youtu.be/-1hx1gef_cc?si=2RsnYOFXfE2JWg7t">video</a>.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">How to Build Levels?</h3>
                    <p>It all depends on the market context. If there was a bullish trend before, the key support is the
                        market minimum
                        after the first deep correction. There was an upward rise, then a correction, and the price rose
                        again. This point
                        will be your key support level from which you will look for buy points.</p>

                    <p>The resistance level in this case is not defined, because the trend can continue. If there was an
                        upward trend and
                        you do not plan to sell, then it is better to focus on support. Selling is undesirable because
                        it requires a good
                        understanding of false breakouts, which I have covered in my videos.</p>

                    <p>Smart Money always uses false breakouts to capture liquidity. Levels are the range of prices
                        within which the price
                        moves. They show the current market value. Levels show the approximate range where the price of
                        the asset is
                        considered cheap, and you need to buy in this zone. We look at the dollar index, but it could be
                        any asset â€” oil,
                        Bitcoin, etc.</p>

                    <p>At the bottom, we have a low cost, and we need to try to buy in this zone. At the top is a high
                        cost, and it is
                        advisable to exit the market here. We buy at support and exit at resistance, but do not sell at
                        resistance. This is
                        important because working against the trend reduces the likelihood of success.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Market Entry Methodology</h3>
                    <p>To enter the market at the support level, I propose the following methodology: at the bottom, you
                        see volumes, and
                        you need to find a seller deficit at the level. Any price level where it is cheap indicates that
                        there will be no
                        supply there, and that is why the price rises from the level. Volumes help to see this. You can
                        see low volumes in
                        the low-cost zone, and these are your buy points. If you see a large volume on the next approach
                        to the level, this
                        is the first sign of a range change.</p>

                    <p>Volume analysis will help you avoid sharp market movements against you. If you watch the volumes
                        at the levels, you
                        will not have problems when the market moves sharply against you. Always wait for a signal at
                        the level, such as a
                        bearish bar on low volume, and then buy. If there is no such signal, skip this level and look
                        for a new situation.
                        It is advisable to study volume analysis to be able to join a new trend according to the
                        principle of level breakout
                        and test.</p>
