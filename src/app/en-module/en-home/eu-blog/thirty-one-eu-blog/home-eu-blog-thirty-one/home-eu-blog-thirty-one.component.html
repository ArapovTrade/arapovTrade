                                Support and resistance levels are key elements of technical analysis used by traders to
                                identify entry and
                                exit points in the market. These levels help evaluate where the price may reverse or
                                continue its movement.
                                In this guide, we will explore how to build levels, determine their significance, and
                                use them effectively
                                in trading.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What Are Support and Resistance Levels?</h2>
                            <p>
                                A support level is a zone where the price finds "support" and begins to rise. A
                                resistance level, on the
                                other hand, represents a barrier where the price encounters sellers and starts to
                                decline. Together, they
                                form the range in which the price moves.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Main Characteristics of Levels</h3>

                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Support:</strong> A zone where demand exceeds supply, causing the price to
                                    rise.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> A zone where supply exceeds demand, causing the price
                                    to fall.</li>
                                <li><strong>Range:</strong> The space between support and resistance levels where the
                                    price moves within a
                                    balance.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>How to Build Levels?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Building levels is an essential skill for a trader. They help structure the chart and
                                identify key zones for
                                decision-making.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Steps to Build Levels</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Identify significant points on the chart where the price sharply changed direction
                                    (peaks and troughs).
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Draw horizontal lines through these points.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Consider the market context: for an uptrend, focus on support; for a downtrend,
                                    focus on resistance.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                            <h3>Market Context</h3>
                            <div class="flex">
                                <img class="pictureImg" src="/assets/img/content/resistance1.png"
                                    alt="Example of Support and Resistance Levels">
                            </div>
                            <p>
                                For an uptrend, the key support is located at the low after the first correction. For a
                                downtrend, the main
                                resistance is at the high after a pullback.
                            </p>

                            <h2>How to Use Levels in Trading?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Support and resistance levels are used for entering and exiting trades. They can be
                                applied in combination
                                with other tools, such as <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/tradingoflevels">level trading</a> or <a

                                    patterns</a>, to improve
                                forecast accuracy.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Trading in a Range</h3>
                            <p>
                                When trading within a range, it is important to understand that the support level is a
                                zone for buying, and
                                resistance is for taking profits. Selling against the trend can be risky and requires
                                specific expertise.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Entry Methodology</h3>
                            <p>
                                Use volume analysis to confirm the strength of the level. For example:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Low volumes at the support zone indicate a lack of supply, making this zone
                                    favorable for buying.</li>
                                <li>High volumes during a retest of resistance may indicate weakness among buyers.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Working with Levels</h2>
