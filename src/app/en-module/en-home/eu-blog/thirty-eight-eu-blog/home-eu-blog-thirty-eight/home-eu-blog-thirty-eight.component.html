                    <p>Hello again everyone! Continuing to record the trading training lecture. My name is Igor Arapov.
                        I am a trader with eleven years of market trading experience, and I am recording a short
                        course on trading training for anyone who wants to learn this profession for free.</p>
                    <p>In the main lesson, where I detailed the theory of trading, I already said that learning to trade
                        on your own is a
                        quite complicated and long path that not everyone completes. Therefore, I recommend learning
                        from those who already
                        practice to avoid bumps along the way. Nevertheless, I believe that theoretical material should
                        be available to the
                        public, so I am posting the theory on trading for those who want to learn independently and do
                        not want to pay for
                        training.</p>
                    <p>So, today's topic will be dedicated to the trading system. In the first video, I detailed the
                        theory of trading,
                        starting from what a stock exchange is, its functionality, purpose, participants, and how it is
                        regulated. We moved
                        on to orders, their types and impact on the price, technical analysis, formations, indicators
                        and their usefulness
                        or uselessness. All this will be in theory. I will definitely provide a link to that recording
                        in this video so that
                        those who start watching not from theory can immediately go there, because I recommend studying
                        trading
                        sequentially.</p>
                    <p>Today we will talk specifically about practice. The theory should end with the student having a
                        trading system that
                        will tell where and when to buy, why to enter the market and when not to. This is the final part
                        of trading
                        training: to have a system that you will follow for life, without deviating left or right. So,
                        let's get to the
                        heart of the matter.</p>
                    <p>We have a futures chart on gold. We have a good situation for buying, and I will explain in
                        detail why it can be
                        considered that gold is reversing and why here it is worth buying, not selling. The basis of any
                        earnings in the
                        market in the form of speculation is buying with the calculation that the price will go up. The
                        logic is simple:
                        buying gold at 2300 and selling at 2330, we pocket the price difference.</p>
                    <p>Now the question arises: how to buy so that the price goes up, not down? The problem with many
                        traders is trading at
                        levels where the market often likes to saw back and forth. Let's discuss why this happens.
                        Levels in technical
                        analysis show where it was expensive and where cheap. But sometimes a level may not work. This
                        is explained by
                        volumes that show the true intentions of market participants.</p>
                    <p>On the internet, the logic of capturing liquidity is actively promoted. It is a justified term
                        because it speaks of
                        the intentions of the participants. In chess, for example, you need to learn to read the
                        intentions of your opponent
                        to win. In the market, it's similar: you need to be able to read the intentions of the
                        participants.</p>
                    <p>Trading is a money game where there are smart and foolish participants. The smart ones take money
                        from the foolish.
                        Therefore, our task is to understand their intentions. In volume analysis, this boils down to
                        looking for large
                        deals. Large participants do not buy directly from the market; they create conditions for
                        capturing liquidity to buy
                        at favorable prices. Volumes show moments when there is a struggle of supply and demand in the
                        market.</p>
                    <p>When the price approaches a level but there are no volumes, this is a signal of market weakness.
                        A real reversal will
                        occur where large players start buying actively. Manipulations create conditions under which
                        other participants are
                        forced to sell at a loss, while large players buy. This is the capture of liquidity.</p>
                    <p>For successful trading, it is important to understand: levels, manipulations at levels, and
                        volumes. Levels show
                        where it is expensive and where cheap, manipulations create conditions for entry, and volumes
                        confirm the intentions
                        of large players.</p>
