                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov. Today, we will talk about <strong
                            class="orange">scalping</strong>.</p>

                    <p><strong class="orange">Scalping</strong> is a popular trading strategy often used by beginners.
                        In this video, I'll
                        discuss its nuances.</p>

                    <p>First, let's define what <strong class="orange">scalping</strong> is. It's when a trader quickly
                        enters the market,
                        makes a profit, and immediately closes the trade. The problem is, the faster you want to make
                        money, the harder it
                        is. Making a profit in short time frames is very challenging.</p>

                    <p>Many traders are not prepared for this type of trading. Now, I'll show you some simple math to
                        understand a scalper's
                        net profit. Look at the commission percentage and ask yourself: are you ready to continue
                        trading this way? Most
                        beginner scalpers don't set <strong class="orange">stop orders</strong>. This is wrong. Without
                        risk control,
                        there's no point in being on the market. Without <strong class="orange">stops</strong>, you're
                        just waiting to lose
                        your account.</p>

                    <p>Now let's do the math. I drew two examples: a scalper and a day trader. Let's assume we bought an
                        asset at 1, the
                        price rose to 10, and we locked in a profit of 9 points. But we have a broker who takes a
                        commission. Whether you
                        trade in profit or loss, the commission is always there. This creates a negative mathematical
                        expectation in the
                        market. If there were no commission, the probabilities would be distributed 50/50. But with the
                        commission, your
                        account is likely to be wiped out with a 99.97% probability.</p>

                    <p>Let's say the commission is 2 points, and you earned 9. Net, you have 7 points left. It seems
                        okay, but if you
                        calculate the commission percentage, it's about 18% of your profit. In <strong
                            class="orange">day trading</strong>,
                        it's 20%. If you have a systematic income, from the entry point to setting a <strong
                            class="orange">stop
                            loss</strong> and exit, and your system gives a positive mathematical expectation, you can
                        use it for a long
                        time.</p>

                    <p>But achieving this in short time frames is difficult. Profit in quick trades is only available
                        through high-frequency
                        arbitrage, which requires expensive technology. The ideal <strong
                            class="orange">scalping</strong> setup is
                        impossible for retail traders. Finding such a system is extremely difficult. Most traders don't
                        set <strong class="orange">stops</strong> because the market might stop them out. This is
                        especially challenging for retail
                        traders.</p>

                    <p>Now, an example of a scalper: he bought an asset at 1, the price rose to 5, he locked in a profit
                        of 4 points, but
                        gave 2 points to the broker. That's 50% of your net profit. Why should the broker get half of
                        your profit? This is
                        the main problem with <strong class="orange">scalping</strong>.</p>

                    <p>If you have everything systematic and professional, you can live and be happy. But for retail
                        traders, it's a trap. A
                        scalper is an excellent client for the exchange because he feeds it. By trading with your money,
                        you are essentially
                        feeding the exchange and the broker. Your money goes to the market and the broker. That's why
                        it's important to
                        reduce commissions. Ideally, to 5 points.</p>

                    <p>If you're a beginner and don't set <strong class="orange">stops</strong>, paying 50% of your
                        profit to the broker
                        creates a negative mathematical expectation. If your system has a negative mathematical
                        expectation, your business
                        is doomed. Commissions are the reason for the negative mathematical expectation. You need to
                        minimize them as much
                        as possible or avoid trading <strong class="orange">scalping</strong>.</p>
