                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov and today we are continuing to discuss the <strong
                            class="orange">“Smart Money”</strong>
                        strategy. In this lesson, we will learn how to identify entry points on charts. As I have
                        mentioned before, volume
                        analysis helps us track the activity of <strong class="orange">“Smart Money”</strong> in the
                        market. Our task is to
                        analyze trading volume in conjunction with price to determine which side of the market the big
                        players are on.</p>
                    <p>Let's start with the basics. I have often emphasized the importance of identifying manipulations
                        and entry points at
                        levels, because levels reflect the value of an asset. Smart money aims to buy at the most
                        favorable prices, and the
                        more, the better. However, fortunately for us as retail traders, they are limited by available
                        liquidity. <strong class="orange">Liquidity</strong> is a key aspect of the market, showing how
                        much can be bought or sold without
                        significantly impacting the price. We can make large trades without greatly affecting the price,
                        whereas large
                        investors cannot boast of this.</p>
                    <p>When <strong class="orange">“Smart Money”</strong> starts accumulation, it usually happens at the
                        end of a downtrend,
                        when market sentiment is very pessimistic, and traders are inclined to sell, fearing further
                        losses. This is the
                        beginning of the <strong class="orange">accumulation phase</strong>. Using volume analysis, we
                        can with high
                        probability determine where this phase begins and ends.</p>
                    <p><strong class="orange">Liquidity</strong> tends to run out. When there is a shortage of supply
                        and demand, it is only
                        a matter of time. Where <strong class="orange">“Smart Money”</strong> starts accumulation, a
                        balance eventually
                        turns into an imbalance. This term means a change in the market state from equilibrium to
                        imbalance. These moments
                        indicate an upcoming trend change. To determine future trend changes, we often only need to see
                        two key volume
                        signals: the presence or absence of liquidity in a certain price range. This forces big capital
                        to influence the
                        price.</p>
                    <p>Before liquidity disappears, <strong class="orange">“Smart Money”</strong> often provokes a false
                        breakout of the
                        level to force everyone who bought in this range to exit their trades.</p>
                    <p>The idea of the <strong class="orange">“Smart Money”</strong> strategy is to look for levels
                        where there is a
                        liquidity shortage — whether in an uptrend or downtrend. Once we identify such a shortage, we
                        can be sure that
                        <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> will soon start taking active actions to change
                        prices. We already know
                        that where there is not enough supply, buyers are forced to influence the price. Therefore, any
                        news or data that
                        can affect the market represents an opportunity for us. As soon as you see a similar pattern — a
                        liquidity shortage
                        and a false breakout — you will be ready for a trend change.
                    </p>
                    <p>Your task is to be able to spot such moments, mark the price levels where accumulation possibly
                        occurred, even though
                        we cannot be 100% sure due to limitations related to <strong class="orange">open
                            interest</strong> on the exchange
                        in real-time. Exchanges often hide open interest in real-time to avoid issues with large volumes
                        of trades. But we
                        understand that where big capital is interested, there is usually a liquidity shortage. This is
                        something that the
                        exchange cannot hide — it is an obvious reality. And we can use this to our advantage.</p>
