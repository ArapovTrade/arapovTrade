                    </h1>
                    <p>Hello everyone! Today I will tell you about a trading system for beginners called "Volume
                        Divergence". It may not
                        bring huge profits and does not give frequent signals, but in the long run, it can help a
                        beginner earn money.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">What is Divergence?</h3>
                    <p>Divergence is a technical term that describes a situation where the price on the chart shows a
                        certain wave, then
                        tries to continue moving in the same direction but cannot, and the market reverses. Why does
                        this happen? Prices are
                        formed through an auction process where participants compete for the price. If there is a sharp
                        drop with high
                        volumes, it may mean that those who bought earlier at higher prices are trying to get rid of
                        their positions due to
                        losses.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">How to Avoid Traps?</h3>
                    <p>To avoid traps that beginners fall into, I suggest a safe trading method. It is important to
                        always monitor
                        divergence. When there is an active price drop with high volumes indicating strong selling, you
                        need to wait for the
                        moment when the price tries to go below the previous low with decreasing volumes. If at this
                        moment volumes do not
                        increase (on the contrary, they decrease), this is the first sign of divergence. The price
                        decreases, but volumes do
                        not grow.</p>

                    <p>Usually, in such situations, when the price goes down, volumes should increase to confirm the
                        continuation of the
                        trend. If this does not happen, it may indicate that sellers have exhausted their resources, and
                        buyers are starting
                        to take control.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Example</h3>
                    <p>For example, after a strong price drop with high volumes, we see an attempt by the market to drop
                        below the previous
                        low again, but volumes do not increase. This is a signal that the strength of the sellers is
                        exhausted, and the
                        market may start to rise.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>All examples show that following these rules can bring profit, but this is not a perfect system.
                        With experience, you
                        can learn more complex methods and strategies that require a deeper theoretical understanding.
                        Therefore, I
                        recommend beginners start with simple systems that allow you to gradually master trading and
                        confidently move
                        forward.</p>
