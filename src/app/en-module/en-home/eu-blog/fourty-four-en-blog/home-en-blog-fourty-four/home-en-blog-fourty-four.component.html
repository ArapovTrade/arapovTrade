                    <p>Hello! Are you just starting your journey in trading? Then this article is for you. My name is
                        Igor Arapov, and I have been
                        trading in the market for 11 years.</p>
                    <p>The first thing you need to understand is where you have come. You have come to a market where
                        prices for goods
                        constantly change. Your goal is to make money from these changes. Trading is pure speculation.
                        The trader's task is
                        to buy low and sell high, or vice versa: sell high and then buy low. You can make money in the
                        market both on rising
                        and falling prices. But to do this, you need to learn to forecast the market. Without this,
                        unfortunately, nothing
                        will work.</p>
                    <p>Mistakes are inevitable, especially at the beginning, and you will realize that you can't just
                        master the market.
                        This is a profession, and any profession requires knowledge. You need to learn trading to be
                        able to forecast the
                        market: where to buy, where to sell, and why exactly this way. This is all connected to the
                        trading system you need
                        to become familiar with.</p>
                    <p>Many beginners do the following: they open a trade, the price moves up and down, they wait for
                        the price to return to
                        the plus, exit, and rejoice, thinking they have made money. But this is a mistaken understanding
                        of the profession.
                        The price of assets often changes sharply and significantly, and does not always return. For
                        example, if you bought
                        Bitcoin at 60,000, thinking it would rise, and hope to wait it out if the price falls, I want to
                        warn you. Central
                        banks control monetary policy, i.e., the amount of money in the economy. When there is a lot of
                        money, assets rise,
                        and Bitcoin rises too. But when the policy changes and there is less money, market participants
                        withdraw their
                        funds, and markets fall. Bitcoin can be worth 60,000, 100,000, or 10,000 for an indefinite time.
                        It all depends on
                        the cycle of monetary policy. This may sound complicated, but you must understand that you are
                        entering a profession
                        where banks make their profits and are professionals in this market. We determine the direction
                        of volumes, read the
                        balance of supply and demand to make money too. One way or another, you will have to learn. The
                        craft is not
                        acquired without theory and training. Prepare yourself to spend time learning, but it will pay
                        off later.</p>
                    <p>If you just trade without a systematic approach, it will most likely end in failure. Any
                        experienced trader who has
                        been in the market for more than six months will confirm this. In my 11 years, I have made many
                        mistakes, and I want
                        to say that if you want to protect yourself from my mistakes, start correctly. I started by
                        reading on the internet
                        and watching videos, but it ended badly. Approach this profession systematically, as if you were
                        studying at a
                        university. By gaining fundamental knowledge, you will earn steadily. If you choose another
                        path, it will most
                        likely end badly, and you will have a negative experience.</p>
                    <p>Trading theory should be free, and there is nothing wrong with that. Therefore, I recorded a full
                        course on technical
                        and volume analysis, posted videos with trading systems, analysis of <span
                            class="orange">“Japanese candles”</span> and the
                        <span class="orange">“1-2-3” </span>trading
                        system. All of this is on my channel for free. Learn and practice, the main thing is that it is
                        beneficial, and do
                        not rush. In trading, the rule works: slow and steady wins the race. The longer you are in the
                        profession, the
                        better the cumulative effect works, you gain experience, and with each new trade, you earn more.
                        Look at this
                        business as a long-term project. Do not try to earn quickly, develop your small business — your
                        deposit, which you
                        strive to increase. Growth will be slow at the beginning, but in the long run, the logic will
                        work, and you will be
                        satisfied.
                    </p>
                    <p>I hope I have given you food for thought. It is important to think about where you have come and
                        whether you are
                        ready to follow the rules because the market punishes those who break them. All rules are
                        written by traders'
                        losses, and they must not be broken if you want to be successful. Learn, and you will succeed.
                    </p>
