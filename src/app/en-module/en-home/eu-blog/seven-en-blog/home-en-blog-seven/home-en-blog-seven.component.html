                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Igor Arapov, and today I will talk about how to make money in trading. For many
                        beginners, this is
                        an important question, and I will try to explain what traders earn on.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Leverage</h3>
                    <p>I want to start with the concept of <span class="orange">“Leverage”</span>. Leverage, or margin,
                        is a tool that
                        allows traders to increase the volume of their trades using borrowed funds. This means that a
                        trader can open a
                        position that significantly exceeds the size of their own capital.</p>

                    <p>It is important to note that many companies provide leverage to their traders. This feature
                        allows trading with a
                        larger volume while having fewer funds, but leverage creates a significant risk for your deposit
                        if you do not know
                        how to use it correctly. Overestimating risk in trading is prohibited because you can lose money
                        if you do not
                        handle market analysis properly.</p>

                    <p>From this logic follows: you need to learn to analyze the market so that when buying gold, the
                        price actually goes up
                        and not the other way around; otherwise, you will incur a loss. To prevent this, you need to
                        study technical market
                        analysis, volume market analysis, the <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> concept,
                        levels — these are all
                        analytical tools used by traders.</p>

                    <p>Once you master these types of analysis, you can start trading. Your task is to predict the
                        price. Simply buying gold
                        and forgetting about it will not work because you are not an investor, and price changes can
                        significantly affect
                        your deposit, especially if you trade with leverage. I already mentioned that trading with
                        leverage carries risk,
                        and this risk needs to be controlled. For this, stop-losses are used — orders that limit risk.
                        In trading, you
                        cannot be a passive observer; you need to actively trade, control trades, and quickly change
                        your opinion about the
                        market.</p>

                    <p>The profession of a trader requires always being on alert and adapting to market changes while
                        controlling risk. Pay
                        attention to profitability in this business. Trading is a high-yield business, but only if you
                        know how to handle it
                        correctly.</p>
