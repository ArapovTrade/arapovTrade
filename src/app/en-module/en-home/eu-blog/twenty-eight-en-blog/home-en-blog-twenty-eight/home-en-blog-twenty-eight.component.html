                    <p>Hello everyone! Today I want to talk about <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong>.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Who are Smart Money?</h3>
                    <p><strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> are the intelligent money that manipulates the
                        market. Our task as
                        traders is to know about them, their techniques, see their actions, and respond accordingly to
                        also make a profit.
                        <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> act rationally: they sell high and buy low. When
                        they are active, high
                        volumes are always visible. That is why volume analysis is so important — it shows where the
                        smart money is active.
                        Where they are active, the price will soon change, and this can be used to your advantage.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">How do Smart Money operate?</h3>
                    <p>Large money is limited in liquidity, so they use tricks. For example, where they need to sell,
                        they create demand.
                        How? Most traders react to levels and place their stop-losses behind them. Those who sell place
                        a stop-loss behind
                        the nearest level, and those who work on the breakout place buy orders. When the price rises
                        above the level,
                        sellers close losses and buy back, while those working on the breakout buy. This creates a large
                        pool of buy
                        liquidity that <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> use. They create demand by breaking
                        the level and
                        actively selling into it. As a result, the exchange registers a huge volume, and after a few
                        small drops, we see
                        that the volume drops sharply — this is a signal that they have finished selling. The market can
                        only fall down.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Conclusion</h3>
                    <p>To effectively use smart money, gather liquidity at levels. At low levels, they buy, at high
                        levels, they sell. Many
                        traders look at levels just like <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong>, so the latter
                        manipulates the price to
                        create favorable conditions for themselves. These are local manipulations but important. When we
                        see a lack of
                        demand at a high price level, it means that <strong class="orange">Smart Money</strong> were
                        selling. This also
                        works at low levels: if the volume decreases on the decline, it means the professionals have
                        already bought, and the
                        market is ready to turn around.</p>
