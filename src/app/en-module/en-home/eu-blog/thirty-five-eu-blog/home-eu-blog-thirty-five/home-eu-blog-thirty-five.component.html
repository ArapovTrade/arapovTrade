                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov and today I will discuss how a professional trades in the
                        market and why many beginner traders
                        lose their money. I
                        often get this question and have already explained the main reasons for losses in the stock
                        market: the mistakes
                        beginners make and what not to do. Today, we will look at it from another angle – how
                        professionals see the market.
                    </p>
                    <p>Beginner traders usually don't know what they are doing, and their trading boils down to guessing
                        the market
                        direction. They don't control risks, so money quickly dissipates, and the account zeros out.
                        We'll look through the
                        eyes of experienced traders to see what's important in trading and try to draw useful
                        conclusions.</p>
                    <p>Today we'll discuss these points, and I hope that after this, you'll choose the correct approach
                        to trading and avoid
                        the mistakes that many beginners make:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong class="orange">What is price.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong class="orange">What is value.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong class="orange">Efficient and inefficient markets.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong class="orange">What is a trend.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong class="orange">The difference between professionals and the crowd.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong class="orange">Which analysis method works.</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Let's delve into it. <strong class="orange">Price</strong> is the amount of money for which the
                        seller is willing to
                        transfer goods. In the stock market, there's an order book where sellers and buyers meet.
                        Sellers indicate the price
                        at which they are willing to sell goods, and buyers – the price at which they are willing to
                        buy. Between them,
                        there is a gap – the spread, the difference between the buying and selling price. Sellers want
                        to sell at a higher
                        price, buyers want to buy cheaper.</p>
                    <p>Trading happens through limit orders in the order book. These are the bids of participants who
                        are ready to sell or
                        buy goods at a certain price. Novices often trade with market orders, not considering levels and
                        value, just
                        following the price chart. If the price is rising, they buy, without thinking about the current
                        value, leading to
                        losses. Not understanding levels, beginners buy high and sell low.</p>
                    <p><strong class="orange">Price</strong> is just the last transaction completed in the market. For
                        instance, a deal
                        could have been at 122, 123, or 127 – it's just the last price. Professionals trade in large
                        volumes, and their
                        supply and demand shape the price on the chart. Small traders usually do not affect the price.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now about <strong class="orange">value</strong>. There is intrinsic value and market-perceived
                        value. Intrinsic value
                        is the real worth of goods, while market-perceived value is how the market sees it. For example,
                        Warren Buffett
                        bought shares of companies that were trading below their liquidation value. This means he was
                        buying shares cheaper
                        than their real worth.</p>
                    <p>An <strong class="orange">efficient market</strong> is where the price accounts for the value,
                        and in such a market,
                        the price usually doesn't move. Professionals work in an inefficient market, where the price
                        does not account for
                        the value. They can buy cheaply what is worth more and make a profit from it.</p>
                    <p>Professionals know the true value better than beginners because trading is a profession, not just
                        playing with
                        charts. They use market inefficiency by buying cheap and selling expensive, which creates a
                        trend.</p>
                    <p>A <strong class="orange">trend</strong> shows that the market is undervaluing or overvaluing
                        goods. Arguing with a
                        trend is one of the key mistakes by beginners. Professionals respond to value, not to price,
                        unlike beginner
                        traders. Analysis methods that work are aimed at identifying transactions by professionals who
                        trade in large
                        volumes. They use <strong class="orange">volume analysis</strong> and the <strong
                            class="orange">Smart Money
                            concept</strong> to manipulate the market and make profits.</p>
                    <p>Earning on the stock market is possible if you understand the nature of trading and follow the
                        smart money.
                        Professionals know how to use the market to their advantage, and it is unnecessary to argue with
                        them. To trade
                        successfully, join the professionals.</p>
                    <p>For those who want to learn trading, you can come to me for tutoring or study materials on my
                        channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ArapovTrade"

                        tried to structure them according to key topics, from the beginner level to the experienced
                        trader's level.</p>
