                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello! My name is Igor Arapov. I have been trading for over 11 years. In this video, I want to
                        help you master the
                        profession of a trader. If you are self-taught, like many beginners, it often ends in failure.
                        The problem is that
                        without a clear structure, the information turns into a mess, and you won't know how to trade.
                        It is best to have a
                        <strong class="orange">trading system</strong>. With it, any trader knows when to buy and sell.
                        I will explain the
                        steps you need to take to achieve this goal.
                    </p>

                    <p>For this, I use manuals that I compiled for my students 5 years ago. They are available in <a
                            href="https://t.me/Arapov_Trade" class="orange dec">“Telegram”</a> in pinned messages. The
                        link will be under the
                        video. I also recorded a full
                        course on trading and technical analysis, which can be found on my <a
                            href="https://youtu.be/XUhWvANL91M" class="orange dec">“YouTube”</a>
                        channel. All of this will help you understand what to study and why, to achieve your goal for
                        free.</p>

                    <p>The first thing you need to do is familiarize yourself with the basics of the market. Learn the
                        terms to understand
                        what traders are talking about. This can be done using a <strong class="orange">glossary of
                            terms</strong>. Then get
                        to know the <strong class="orange">exchange</strong>: what it is, what is traded on it, who its
                        participants are,
                        and how it is regulated. This is important for general understanding.</p>

                    <p>Volume analysis of the market is the basis of my approach to trading. To confidently read <strong
                            class="orange">volumes</strong>, you need to trust the information received. Any normal
                        exchange has <strong class="orange">clearing</strong>, controlling the fairness of trades.
                        <strong class="orange">Volumes</strong>
                        are not just graphs at the bottom of the screen but important information. Study it to be
                        confident in your actions.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Learning should be built from simple to complex</h3>
                    <p><strong class="orange">Market basics</strong> are the foundation. You can't skip these topics, or
                        you will have to
                        make them up later. The goal of learning is to have a clear idea of where and when to open
                        trades. It all starts
                        with the basics, which need to be mastered quickly and easily.</p>

                    <p>Next, study the types of market analysis. <strong class="orange">Fundamental analysis</strong>
                        can be skipped as it
                        is complex and requires a deep understanding of <strong class="orange">macroeconomics</strong>.
                        <strong class="orange">Technical analysis</strong> is your field. This is where trading begins:
                        types of charts, types
                        of trends, main patterns. They need to be known but not necessarily sought out. <strong
                            class="orange">Volume
                            analysis</strong> is what I teach. Here you need to learn to read <strong
                            class="orange">volumes</strong>. Big
                        capital sells on the rise and buys on the fall. Understanding this, you can profit from an
                        inefficient market.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Types of orders</h3>
                    <p>It is also important to understand the types and kinds of orders. I have a video on this topic on
                        the channel.
                        Understanding <strong class="orange">limit orders</strong> and their impact on the market will
                        explain why volume
                        analysis is so important.</p>

                    <p>After theory, move on to the specific study of <strong class="orange">volumes</strong>. I talk
                        about the trading
                        method, phases of market movement, reasons for trend changes. All this needs to be mastered
                        because it is the basis
                        of your understanding of trading. Pay special attention to priority change levels. This is a
                        <strong class="orange">technical pattern</strong> that works well. Learn the basics of volume in
                        the <strong class="orange">VSA</strong> system, linking price with volume. This will help you
                        use the trading system.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Managing deposit and risks</h3>
                    <p>Managing your deposit and risks, setting <strong class="orange">stop-losses</strong>, calculating
                        position size —
                        this is the basis of <strong class="orange">money management</strong>. Profit is made over the
                        long run, not in one
                        trade. Understanding this will help you trade successfully.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Trading psychology</h3>
                    <p>The section on <strong class="orange">psychology</strong> is also very important. When you start
                        earning, greed
                        comes, which ruins many traders. Read and master this section to avoid mistakes.</p>

                    <p>By studying all these sections, you will be able to trade confidently and not depend on news,
                        rumors, and advice. Set
                        <strong class="orange">stop-losses</strong> — this is the golden rule of trading.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you want to develop confidently and not fear that one day you will find an empty deposit, I
                        hope this video helps
                        you. If you decide to study on your own, remember that beginners often do this. Experienced
                        traders who have
                        experienced failures usually come to training to get a trading system. I hope beginners will not
                        repeat our mistakes
                        because they are costly and painful.</p>
