                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello, friends! I'm Igor Arapov, and today I will talk about the key phases of the market. This
                        topic is very
                        important for those who want to become successful traders.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">So, the main phases of the market:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>trend;</li>
                        <li>balance;</li>
                        <li>trend change.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Every asset goes through these phases, and your task is to timely determine which phase you are
                        in. One of the most
                        important rules you should remember is that the market is constantly changing.</p>

                    <p>Impulse movements are followed by periods of calm when the market digests information. Even if
                        the market is actively
                        moving, there will come a moment of consolidation â€” a sideways movement that can last for a long
                        time. These are the
                        main elements of market movement.</p>

                    <p>For example, American writer, stock, and commodity trader <span class="orange">Larry
                            Williams</span> in his book
                        <span class="orange">"Long-Term Secrets to Short-Term Trading"</span> highlights two main
                        patterns: expansion and
                        contraction.
                    </p>

                    <p>The market cannot move in one direction forever or stay in place. The main constants of any
                        market are contraction
                        and expansion. Expansion is a trending movement, and the trader's task is to recognize it in
                        time and join in.</p>

                    <p>The key skill of a trader is to determine the phase of the cycle. Before the start of a trend,
                        there are signs that
                        help to identify it. And now I will talk about the balance phase of the market, which needs to
                        be understood and
                        mastered as it precedes the trend phase. Successful traders follow the trend.</p>

                    <p>Comfortable trading is following the trend. Understanding how a trend is born allows you not only
                        to enter a new
                        trend in time but also to protect yourself from working against it. This helps avoid large
                        losses that often occur
                        when trading against the trend.</p>

                    <p>The market forgives many mistakes, but there will come a moment when it will punish for them.
                        Trading against the
                        trend is one of the critical mistakes that should never be made. We will analyze the trend
                        change using the <span class="orange">Smart Money</span> concept and volume analysis. Volume
                        analysis helps determine trends and
                        understand what is happening in the market.</p>

                    <p>The market is a non-linear system, and a trader needs to be attentive and focused. Living in a
                        changing environment
                        is difficult, and the market is exactly that kind of environment.</p>
