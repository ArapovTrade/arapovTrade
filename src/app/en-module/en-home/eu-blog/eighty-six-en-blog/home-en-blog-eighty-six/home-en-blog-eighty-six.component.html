                                    that helps traders identify a potential trend reversal or continuation. This
                                    pattern can be used in forex, the stock market, cryptocurrencies, and even
                                    in commodity trading, such as gold and oil. The core principle lies in a sequence of
                                    three
                                    points that form a potential trade entry zone.</p>

                                <p>The 1-2-3 formation is one of the simplest and most reliable patterns
                                    as it does not require complex
                                    indicators or deep fundamental analysis. It can be applied in both

                                </p>

                                <p><strong>How is the 1-2-3 pattern formed?</strong> The most important feature is
                                    the sequence of price movements:</p>

                                <p>1️⃣ The price first forms a local extreme – point 1 (a high
                                    in a downtrend
                                    or a low in an uptrend).</p>

                                <p>2️⃣ A correction follows, creating point 2, which becomes
                                    a key support
                                    or resistance level.</p>

                                <p>3️⃣ Then, the price makes another move, but it does not surpass the previous
                                    extreme,
                                    forming point 3, which serves as a potential reversal signal.</p>

                                <p>🔹 <strong>Breaking the level of point 2</strong> is the main trading signal that
                                    confirms the final
                                    market direction.</p>
                                <div class="flex">

                                <h3>Why is the 1-2-3 pattern important?</h3>
                                <p>This pattern helps traders avoid premature market entries and filter out
                                    false breakouts.
                                    Traders use it for trading on <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/timeframes">various timeframes</a>,
                                    from M5 to D1.
                                    On lower timeframes, it is ideal for
                                    scalping, while on higher ones, it is useful for
                                    <strong>medium-term and long-term trading</strong>.
                                </p>

                                <p>One key advantage of the 1-2-3 pattern is that it does not require complex
                                    indicators such as MACD,
                                    Bollinger Bands, or Stochastic. However, it can be combined with volume
                                    indicators and
                                    support and resistance levels to enhance signal accuracy.
                                </p>

                                <h3>When is the 1-2-3 pattern most effective?</h3>
                                <p>The pattern delivers the best results when:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>It forms after a strong trend, signaling a possible reversal.</li>
                                    <li>There is an increase in volume at the breakout of point 2,
                                        confirming the strength of the movement.</li>
                                    <li>It aligns with key support or resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li>It is confirmed by other indicators such as <strong>RSI or MACD</strong>.
                                    </li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>Using this pattern in combination with proper
                                    risk management and volume analysis
                                    allows traders to identify optimal entry points and increase
                                    the percentage of successful trades.

                                <p>The <strong>1-2-3</strong> pattern is one of the most effective figures in technical

                                    day trading
                                    and long-term investments.

                                <h3>How is the 1-2-3 Pattern Formed?</h3>
                                <p>The 1-2-3 formation can be found on any timeframe, from M1 to D1 and
                                    beyond. However, the most
                                    reliable signals appear on higher timeframes (H1, H4, D1). Let’s break down the key
                                    elements:</p>
                                <div class="flex">
                                    <img class="pictureImg" src="/assets/img/content/pattern-1-2-3-2.png" loading="lazy"
                                        alt="How is the 1-2-3 Pattern Formed?">
                                </div>
                                <p><strong>➊ Point 1</strong> – this is the local price extreme. If
                                    the trend is bullish,
                                    point 1 is the high; if the trend is bearish, it is the low.</p>

                                <p><strong>➋ Point 2</strong> – the correction level, which may become a
                                    key
                                    <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/levelofsupport">support or resistance
                                        level</a>. At this stage, the price pulls
                                    back but
                                    does not yet confirm a trend reversal.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>➌ Point 3</strong> – the potential reversal zone, but it is crucial that it
                                    does not break point 1.
                                    If point 3 forms above point 1 (in an uptrend) or below (in a
                                    downtrend), it increases
                                    the likelihood of a false breakout.</p>

                                <p>🔥 <strong>Key moment:</strong> The breakout of point 2 is the main trading signal.
                                    It
                                    confirms the trend reversal
                                    or continuation.</p>

                                <h3>What Are the Signs of a Well-Formed Pattern?</h3>
                                <p>To correctly identify the 1-2-3 model on a chart, traders should consider
                                    several important factors:</p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>The pattern should form at significant support or
                                        resistance levels.</li>
                                    <li>There should be an increase in volume after the breakout of point 2,
                                        confirming the validity of the breakout.</li>
                                    <li>Reversal candlestick patterns may appear at point 3,
                                        such as <em>pin bar, engulfing</em>.</li>
                                    <li>If point 3 forms at <a class="linkrefinto"
                                            href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/fibonaccilevels">Fibonacci
                                            levels</a> (38.2%, 50%,
                                        61.8%), this strengthens the signal.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Additional indicators such as RSI, MACD, or Stochastic
                                        can confirm trend weakening.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>When Does the 1-2-3 Pattern Provide the Most Reliable Signals?</h3>
                                <p>Not every pattern formation guarantees success. Strong signals appear when:</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>The pattern emerges after a prolonged trend, signaling a
                                        potential reversal.</li>

                                    <li> <strong>Volume increases</strong> during the breakout of point 2, indicating
                                        the presence of large
                                        market players.</li>

                                    <li> The pattern forms on higher timeframes (H1, H4, D1) –
                                        the
                                        higher
                                        the timeframe, the
                                        more reliable the signal.</li>

                                    <li>The price confirms the breakout with a retest, reducing the likelihood
                                        of a false move.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <ul>

                                    <li> If the price quickly returns to the range after breaking point 2,
                                        it may be a false breakout.
                                    </li>

                                    <li> If volume does not increase during the breakout of point 2, it signals
                                        trend weakness.</li>

                                    <li> If point 3 forms too far from point 2, it
                                        increases the probability of a complex
                                        breakout.</li>

                                <p>The 1-2-3 pattern is a universal tool for identifying trend reversals
                                    or continuations.
                                    It is used by both professional traders and beginners because it is easy to
                                    interpret and provides
                                    <strong>clear trading signals</strong>. However, to improve accuracy, it should be

                                <p>The right market entry point is a key factor for successful trading using the
                                    <strong>1-2-3</strong> pattern.
                                    The main rule is that the trade is opened after the <strong>breakout of point
                                        2</strong>.
                                    Depending on the market direction, the following positions are opened:
                                </p>

                                <ul>
                                    <li>📈 <strong>Long position (BUY):</strong> if the price breaks above point 2,
                                        confirming an uptrend.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>📉 <strong>Short position (SELL):</strong> if the price breaks below point 2,
                                        signaling a downtrend.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <h3>Main Entry Strategies</h3>
                                <p>Traders use <strong>two entry methods</strong> when trading the 1-2-3 pattern:</p>

                                <p><strong>1️⃣ Conservative Entry:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Wait for a strong candle close beyond point 2.</li>
                                    <li> Confirm the breakout with increased volume or divergence in <strong>RSI,
                                            MACD</strong>.</li>
                                    <li> Minimize the risk of a false breakout but may miss part of the move.</li>

                                </ul>


                                <p><strong>2️⃣ Aggressive Entry:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Open a trade immediately upon touching point 2.</li>
                                    <li> Possibility to enter the trend earlier, but the risk of a false breakout is
                                        higher.</li>
                                    <li> It is recommended to use a <a class="linkrefinto"

                                        nearest support
                                        or resistance level.</li>

                                <h3>When to Enter a Trade?</h3>
                                <p>The optimal entry depends on market conditions:</p>
                                <p>🔹 If the breakout is accompanied by increased volume, it confirms
                                    the strength of the trend.</p>
                                <p>🔹 If a reversal candlestick pattern forms at point 3
                                    (such as <em>pin bar</em> or
                                    <em>engulfing</em>),
                                    it strengthens the signal.
                                </p>
                                <p>🔹 If the price tests the support or resistance level before
                                    breaking out, it provides additional
                                    confirmation.</p>

                                <h3>Retest of Point 2 – The Best Entry Opportunity</h3>
                                <p>📌 Often, after a breakout, the price returns to point 2, testing this
                                    level. This is called a
                                    <strong>retest</strong>
                                    and is one of the best opportunities for entry.
                                </p>

                                <p>🔥 <strong>How to Use a Retest?</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Wait for the price to pull back to point 2.</li>

                                        (such as <a class="linkrefinto"

                                    <li>Open a trade with minimal risk – stop-loss can be placed
                                        behind point 3.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>💡 <strong>Advantages of Entering on a Retest:</strong></p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> Reduces the risk of a false breakout.</li>
                                    <li> Allows entering at a better price.</li>
                                    <li> Provides an opportunity to observe price behavior before the final move.</li>
                                </ul>



                                <p>The choice of trade entry timing depends on the trading style and risk level.
                                    <strong>Conservative entry</strong>
                                    reduces the likelihood of losses
                                    but may miss part of the move. <strong>Aggressive entry</strong> allows entering
                                    earlier but with higher
                                    risk.
                                    The best option is to wait for a retest of point 2, increasing the chances
                                    of a successful trade.
                                </p>

                                <h2>Where to Set Stop-Loss and Take-Profit?</h2>
                                <p>Proper placement of <strong>Stop-Loss</strong> and <strong>Take-Profit</strong>
                                    levels is one
                                    of the key factors for successful trading using the <strong>1-2-3</strong> pattern.
                                    These levels help minimize risks and lock in profits at optimal points.</p>

                                <h3>How to Set a Stop-Loss?</h3>
                                <p>A stop-loss should be placed at a level that protects the position from random
                                    market fluctuations but does not prematurely stop the trade before the main move.
                                    There are several stop placement strategies:</p>

                                <p>📌 <strong>1. Below point 3 (for buys) or above point 3 (for sells).</strong></p>
                                <p> This is a classic option that reduces the likelihood of exiting the trade too early.
                                </p>
                                <p> The farther point 3 is from point 2, the higher the probability of a reliable
                                    pattern formation.</p>

                                <p>📌 <strong>2. Based on the ATR indicator (Average True Range).</strong></p>
                                <p> ATR measures an asset’s volatility, helping to place the stop-loss at a safe level.
                                </p>
                                <p> To set a stop, multiply the current ATR value by a coefficient (usually 1.5–2) and
                                    add/subtract from the entry point.</p>

                                <p> 📌 <strong>3. Dynamic stop-loss (trailing stop).</strong></p>
                                <p> Helps protect profits by moving the stop-loss along with the price movement.</p>
                                <p> Suitable for trending markets but requires active monitoring.</p>

                                <h3>How to Set Take-Profit Correctly?</h3>
                                <p>Take-profit is the level where a trader secures profits. Placement options:</p>

                                <p>🏆 <strong>1. First level – nearest key support or resistance level.</strong></p>
                                <p> This is the safest option, especially if the pattern forms near strong levels.</p>

                                <p>🏆 <strong>2. Second level – projection of the 1-2-3 pattern height.</strong></p>
                                <p> Calculated by measuring the distance from point 1 to point 2 and extending it from
                                    the breakout point.</p>
                                <p> This method is often used for long-term targets.</p>

                                <p>🏆 <strong>3. Partial trade closure + trailing stop.</strong></p>
                                <p> The first portion of the trade is closed at the first target, while the remaining
                                    position is managed with a
                                    trailing stop.</p>
                                <p> This reduces risks while allowing traders to capitalize on trend continuation.</p>

                                <h3>Additional Recommendations for Setting Stop-Loss and Take-Profit</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li> <strong>Consider volatility:</strong> during high volatility, stop-loss
                                        should be placed further away.</li>
                                    <li> <strong>Don’t place the stop-loss too close:</strong> otherwise, random
                                        fluctuations may stop you out.</li>
                                    <li> <strong>Lock in profits in portions:</strong> this allows you to secure part of
                                        the profits
                                        in case of pullbacks.</li>
                                </ul>

                                <p>The strategy for setting stop-loss and take-profit
                                    depends on asset volatility,
                                    trading style, and risk tolerance.
                                    The optimal approach is a combined strategy – securing part of the
                                    profits at nearby
                                    levels while managing the remaining portion with
                                    a dynamic stop. This allows traders to maximize the potential
                                    of the <strong>1-2-3</strong> pattern in trading.</p>

                                <h3>Main Mistakes When Entering a Trade</h3>
                                <p><strong>🚨 Entering Before the Breakout of Point 2</strong></p>
                                <p>One of the most frequent mistakes is <strong>premature entry</strong> into the
                                    market,
                                    where a trader tries to anticipate the breakout of point 2. This can lead to a false
                                    signal if the price
                                    reverses in the opposite direction.
                                </p>

                                <p><strong>How to Avoid It?</strong></p>
                                <p>✔ Wait for the <strong>candle to close</strong> beyond point 2.</p>
                                <p>✔ Use the <strong>retest</strong> of the breakout for a more precise entry.</p>

                                <p><strong>🚨 Ignoring Volume</strong></p>
                                <p>If volume does not increase during the breakout of point 2, this may indicate
                                    a false move.
                                    Large players often create fake breakouts to "shake out" the market before
                                    the real move.</p>

                                <p><strong>How to Avoid It?</strong></p>
                                <p>✔ Monitor <strong>volume indicators (Volume, OBV)</strong> – increasing volume at
                                    the breakout confirms the strength
                                    of the signal.</p>
                                <p>✔ Use additional <a class="linkrefinto"

                                    such as <strong>RSI or MACD</strong>,
                                    to assess market dynamics.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Misinterpreting the Pattern</h3>
                                <p><strong>🚨 Expecting the "Perfect" Pattern</strong></p>
                                <p>The market rarely forms perfectly symmetrical models. Many traders
                                    miss good
                                    opportunities,
                                    waiting for an "ideal" 1-2-3 pattern structure.</p>

                                <p><strong>How to Avoid It?</strong></p>
                                <p>✔ Understand that minor deviations from the "classic" form are normal.</p>
                                <p>✔ Analyze the <strong>trend structure</strong>, not just the pattern shape.</p>

                                <h3>Risk Management Mistakes</h3>
                                <p><strong>🚨 Placing the Stop-Loss Too Close</strong></p>
                                <p>Setting a stop-loss too close to the entry point leads to frequent stop-outs
                                    due to random market fluctuations.</p>

                                <p><strong>How to Avoid It?</strong></p>
                                <p>✔ Place the stop-loss below/above point 3 or consider market volatility using
                                    <strong>ATR (Average True Range).</strong>
                                </p>
                                <p>✔ Use a <strong>trailing stop</strong> to protect profits in case of a strong move.
                                </p>

                                <h3>How to Minimize Mistakes?</h3>
                                <p>📌 Wait for a confirmation signal before entering.</p>
                                <p>📌 Always analyze volume and additional indicators.</p>
                                <p>📌 Set an appropriate stop-loss considering market
                                    volatility.</p>
                                <p>📌 Apply risk management: do not risk more than 1-2% of your deposit per
                                    trade.</p>

                                <p>Understanding these mistakes and avoiding them significantly increases the chances of
                                    successful
                                    trading with the <strong>1-2-3</strong> pattern.

                                    traders minimize

                                <h3>Key Rules for Successful Trading with the 1-2-3 Pattern:</h3>
                                <p>🔹 <strong>Entry point:</strong> the best time to enter a trade is the breakout of
                                    point 2.</p>
                                <p>🔹 <strong>Filtering false signals:</strong> using volume and indicators
                                    to confirm the breakout.</p>
                                <p>🔹 <strong>Risk management:</strong> placing a stop-loss
                                    below/above point 3 or calculating it based on ATR.</p>
                                <p>🔹 <strong>Optimal exit strategy:</strong> taking profit in portions or using a
                                    trailing stop.</p>
