                    </h1>

                    <p> Hello everyone! Today we will talk about <strong class="orange">volume analysis of
                            markets</strong>. The method of volume analysis
                        originated in the 1900s when Richard Wyckoff, the founder of this method, worked as an editor
                        for a Wall
                        Street-related newspaper. He noticed that there are "smart money" in the market — those who
                        constantly make money on
                        the stock market, whether in a “bull” or “bear” trend. Wyckoff introduced the concept of "market
                        operator" — a
                        collective term for all these “smart players”. According to his logic, “smart money” operates
                        like wholesalers: they
                        buy goods cheaply in bulk and sell them at retail for a profit.</p>
                    <p>Wyckoff identified phases in the market: the “<strong class="orange">accumulation
                            phase</strong>”, where market
                        operators actively buy the instrument (whether precious metals, stocks, or currency — it doesn't
                        matter), and the
                        “<strong class="orange">distribution phase</strong>”, where the crowd starts buying what it
                        previously wanted to get
                        rid of. There is a peculiar psychology at work in the market: the crowd acts irrationally, while
                        “smart money” acts
                        rationally.</p>
                    <p>To understand “<strong class="orange">volume analysis</strong>”, you need to learn to identify
                        the phases.
                        Unfortunately, there are fewer such "pictures" in the market as it becomes more complex. Volumes
                        are often "drawn"
                        to confuse those who track the traces of “smart money”. However, the levels we identify as cheap
                        and expensive still
                        fit into Wyckoff's logic.</p>
