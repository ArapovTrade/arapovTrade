                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today I want to talk about paid trading education.
                        This topic isn't very
                        popular among traders, but it's important. Let's figure out if it's worth paying for education.
                        I'll present
                        arguments for and against so you can make the right decision.</p>

                    <p>To begin with, paying for trading education isn't typical for many people, especially beginners.
                        Usually, experienced
                        traders come to me, tired of losses and self-education. They understand that it's easier to
                        come, learn, get a
                        trading strategy, and practice it than to search for it on their own.</p>

                    <p>When you start learning on your own, you need to find your trading method and experiment. And
                        experiments in the
                        market cost money. I lost 2 years on self-education myself, so I can confidently say: it's not
                        the best way to
                        become a trader. Loss of time is also a loss of money.</p>

                    <p>If you don't mind losing time, you can try learning on your own. I have a free playlist on my
                        channel called "Trading
                        from Scratch." There, I cover the main topics and provide a full course on technical analysis.
                        This knowledge will
                        help you master the theory of trading.</p>

                    <p>The difference between me and a beginner trader is that an experienced trader is more stable,
                        reliable, and
                        profitable. In any case, you'll gain your experience. But under mentorship, you'll get the
                        knowledge that's
                        necessary for you. A mentor will explain what to do right and what not.</p>

                    <p>Paid education is effective; otherwise, it wouldn't cost money. But it's important not to buy
                        education from people
                        who can't show their results. Education should include not only theory but also practice.
                        Studying theory on your
                        own, you can get confused. Often, experienced traders come to me with such a "mess" in their
                        heads that needs to be
                        "sorted out."</p>

                    <p>Ideally, teach a trader from scratch. Such people become traders faster, they don't have internal
                        barriers. When
                        you're learning, it's important to let go of the knowledge you've invested a lot of effort into
                        if it turns out to
                        be wrong. Success depends not on the amount of knowledge but on its correctness.</p>

                    <p>On one side of the scale is your time and money, on the other is paid mentorship. You don't need
                        to pay for trading
                        theory; everything is on the internet. When I started, there wasn't such an abundance of
                        information. Now everything
                        is available, and many can learn on their own. But this is more for the most talented, who see
                        the whole picture and
                        can highlight the nuances.</p>

                    <p>If you're capable of grasping all the theory and highlighting the nuances, you don't need a
                        tutor. But there are few
                        such people. Most people are average in abilities, like me. Life showed me that I couldn't do it
                        on my own. I tried
                        for 2 years but didn't have enough strength and information.</p>

                    <p>But even with this information, it's not guaranteed that you'll reach your goal. Trading is both
                        a general
                        theoretical base and practical nuances. You need to practice. In my training, there is always
                        practice, and the
                        trader must pass an exam of thirty trades.</p>

                    <p>The trader makes trades and shows what they've learned because the market is honest. It doesn't
                        forgive mistakes. In
                        lessons, you can say everything is clear, but practice will show everything. Theory is not
                        enough. Theory is good,
                        but until you put it into practice, the result won't be the same.</p>

                    <p>To sum up, beginner students can try on their own. Young people with energy and desire can try.
                        Students, as a rule,
                        don't have money, so it's fair.</p>

                    <p>If you're no longer a student and want to earn, treat trading as a business. Go to a practicing
                        person, learn from
                        them, and start working. It's like going to university, getting a degree, and starting to work.
                    </p>

                    <p>Write in the comments what you think about paid education. Is it necessary at all? I'll be glad
                        to hear any opinion.
                        I've provided objective arguments: trading theory costs nothing, only tutoring costs. The main
                        thing is for the
                        education to lead to results. If there are no results, it costs nothing.</p>
