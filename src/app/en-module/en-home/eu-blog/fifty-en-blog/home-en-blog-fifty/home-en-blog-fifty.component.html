                    </h1>

                    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Igor Arapov, and today we will talk about <strong
                            class="orange">algorithmic orders</strong>. In one of my
                        previous publications, I discussed the types of orders and their impact on price. Today, we will
                        delve deeper into
                        this topic to learn about the advantages of large market participants over regular traders and
                        make useful
                        conclusions.</p>

                    <p>To begin with, I asked an AI to gather information about the types of <strong
                            class="orange">algorithmic
                            orders</strong> on the “CME” exchange. The <span class="orange  ">“CME”</span> exchange is a
                        transparent, regulated exchange, and all information about it is
                        honest and verified.</p>

                    <p>It is important to note that <strong class="orange">market orders</strong> are executed by small
                        participants 95% of
                        the time, who are just starting to trade. They only have two buttons with their broker - buy and
                        sell - which are
                        executed at the best available price. These traders usually do not use other types of orders,
                        whereas there are many
                        <strong class="orange">algorithmic orders</strong> that help conceal the final order.
                    </p>

                    <p>More experienced traders understand that there are large players in the market. For success, it
                        is important to
                        monitor their actions, as large participants usually have a better understanding of the market.
                        They use clever
                        <strong class="orange">algorithmic orders</strong> to hide their intentions from small traders.
                        When executed, they
                        always conceal the size of their order.
                    </p>

                    <p>We pay attention to <strong class="orange">volume</strong> because it shows the number of orders
                        executed. The
                        information in the “order book” shows intentions, but it is difficult to trust because large
                        players can "play" the
                        “order book,” hiding the true size of their orders.</p>

                    <p><strong class="orange">Algorithmic orders</strong> are aimed at execution at a specific price.
                        Price levels and
                        <strong class="orange">volume</strong> are important because large players buy or sell at
                        certain levels. If an
                        asset is expensive, a large player will not buy, and the price will fall. If an asset is cheap,
                        big capital will
                        buy, but it will have to push the price up due to limited liquidity.
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Conclusion:</h3>
                    <p>Large players use all technologies to ensure their orders are executed quickly and discreetly,
                        with minimal impact on
                        price. The retail trader cannot compete with them and often uses market orders.</p>

                    <p>If we know that the task of big capital is to fill their order at a certain price, we must wait
                        for them to do so. We
                        will see spikes in <strong class="orange">volumes</strong> and activity at levels. When
                        liquidity disappears, we can
                        carefully join in.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Key takeaway:</h3>
                    <p>Levels work if used correctly. Simply buying at a level is not always a successful strategy.
                        Before a price reversal,
                        there may be fluctuations that can lead to losses. It is important to know when to buy from a
                        level.</p>

                    <p>In the <strong class="orange">“Smart Money”</strong> concept, a false breakout is a signal to
                        act. Big capital
                        accumulates liquidity, knocking out the stops of those who joined the movement. They create a
                        shakeout before the
                        movement begins, as stops are located nearby.</p>

                    <p>A retail trader can always buy and sell in the market because the <strong class="orange">market
                            maker</strong>
                        provides liquidity. You need to wait for the right level, see the activity of big capital
                        through <strong class="orange">volumes</strong>, see the liquidity shortage and manipulations,
                        and join in. This will help avoid
                        market manipulations and set stops correctly.</p>

                    <p>That's it for now. I hope the information on <strong class="orange">algorithmic orders</strong>
                        was useful in the
                        context of levels and volumes, and you understood why it is important to know.</p>
