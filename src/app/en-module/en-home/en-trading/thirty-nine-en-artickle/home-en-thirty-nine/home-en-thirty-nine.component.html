                        </span>
                    </h1>


                    <p class="orange">A successful trading system consists of two parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>limiting losses</li>
                        <li>timely profit-taking</li>
                    </ul>


                    <p>Sometimes traders' strategies involve a strict ratio of stop and take
                        profit positions, for
                        example, 1 to 3. Thus, a stop of 10 points will correspond to a take profit of 30.</p>
                    <p>The ratio can be any, but it is not advisable to set too long take profits without a good reason
                        â€” often
                        overestimating the price drivers leads to the trader not securing a solid profit, and a reversal
                        occurs before
                        reaching the long take.</p>
                    <p>At the same time, it is necessary to remember that in such a case the take profit must exceed the
                        stop, as a rare
                        strategy allows the trader to trade without losses, and short stops imply that, for example, two
                        losing trades can
                        compensate for one profitable one.</p>
