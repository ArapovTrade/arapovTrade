                            <h3>Fundamental Knowledge</h3>
                            <p>Before starting trading, it’s essential to understand the basic principles of trading:
                                how markets work, what
                                assets are, and how prices are formed. A solid understanding of these fundamentals will
                                help you confidently
                                analyze the situation and make well-informed decisions.</p>

                            <h3>Choosing a Broker</h3>
                            <p>Find a broker with a license, a good reputation, and suitable trading conditions. Pay
                                attention to
                                commissions, spreads, and the platform. Also, check for available educational materials
                                and the quality of
                                technical support for beginner traders.</p>

                            <h2>2. Develop a Trading Plan</h2>
                            <h3>Goals and Strategy</h3>
                            <p>Create a clear <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/tradingplan">trading
                                    plan</a> with profit targets and risk
                                management rules. Record which strategies you use to track their effectiveness in
                                practice and make the
                                necessary adjustments.</p>

                            <h3>Entry and Exit Points</h3>
                            <p>Determine the conditions for entering and exiting a trade. Use <strong><a
                                        class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/stoploss">stop-loss</a></strong> and
                                <strong>take-profit</strong> to automate your trades. This will help minimize losses and
                                secure profits even
                                when you are temporarily unavailable to monitor the market.
                            </p>
                            <h2>3. Manage Risks</h2>
                            <h3>Limiting Losses</h3>
                            <p>Do not risk more than 1–2% of your capital on a single trade. This approach helps
                                maintain balance even during a
                                series of losses and provides an opportunity to endure unfavorable market periods.</p>

                            <h3>Diversification</h3>
                            <p>Distribute your capital across different assets to minimize risks associated with the
                                decline of one instrument. Add
                                instruments with varying volatility and correlation to balance your portfolio.</p>

                            <h2>4. Practice on a Demo Account</h2>
                            <h3>Safe Start</h3>
                            <p>Use a demo account to test strategies and learn the platform without financial risks.
                                This approach allows beginners
                                to master the market and prepare for real trading.</p>

                            <h3>Trade Analysis</h3>
                            <p>Take demo trading seriously: keep a trading journal and analyze your results. Record your
                                decisions, emotions, and
                                mistakes to improve your trading skills.</p>

                            <h3>Trading Psychology</h3>
                            <p>Emotions are a trader's worst enemy. Fear, greed, and excitement hinder the objective
                                evaluation of the market and
                                adherence to your plan. Effective emotional control helps minimize impulsive decisions.
                            </p>
                            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Take breaks after unsuccessful trades and avoid emotional trading.

                                focused on long-term goals.</p>

                            <h3>Meditation and Focus</h3>
                            <p>Practice relaxation methods, such as meditation, to maintain calm and focus during
                                trading. Regular short breaks help
                                restore mental balance and improve productivity.</p>

                            <h2>6. Learn from Your Mistakes</h2>
                            <h3>Keeping a Journal</h3>
                            <p>Record every trade: reasons for entry, outcome, and conclusions. Analyzing the journal
                                helps identify weak points and
                                spot patterns in your decisions.</p>

                            <h3>Strategy Optimization</h3>
                            <p>Based on your error analysis, adjust your trading strategy and plan to enhance their
                                effectiveness. Regularly
                                updating your approach based on experience is key to consistent growth.</p>

                            <h2>7. Stay Informed About News and Markets</h2>
                            <h3>Fundamental Analysis</h3>
                            <p>Economic events, such as <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/majorbankfrs">central bank
                                    decisions</a> or GDP reports, impact asset prices and can trigger sharp market
                                movements.</p>
                            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use an economic calendar to track key events and plan trades in a
                                timely manner.</p>

                            <h3>Global Trends</h3>
                            <p>Study global changes in financial markets to understand the long-term prospects of
                                assets. Global trends often form
                                the foundation for positional and long-term trading.</p>

                            <h2>8. Maintain Discipline and Patience</h2>
                            <h3>Following the Strategy</h3>
                            <p>Stick to your chosen strategy without giving in to impulses or the fear of missing out on
                                opportunities. Discipline
                                in trading is the key to stable and well-reasoned decisions.</p>

                            <h3>Gradual Development</h3>
                            <p>Success in trading takes time. Do not expect instant results—gradually build your skills
                                and experience while
                                focusing on learning and analyzing your actions.</p>

                            <h2>9. Avoid Overusing Leverage</h2>
                            <h3>Risks of Leverage</h3>
                            <p><a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/forexleveragerisk">Leverage</a> allows
                                you to
                                control large amounts of capital but also increases the risk of losses. Beginners are
                                better off using moderate
                                leverage (1:10–1:20).</p>
                            <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Calculate your position size to avoid exposing your deposit to
                                excessive risk and maintain a
                                balance between profit and safety.</p>

                            <h3>Example Calculation</h3>
                            <p>With a $1,000 deposit and 1:10 leverage, your position size will be $10,000. However, a
                                1% loss means a $100 loss—10%
                                of your deposit, which creates significant pressure on capital.</p>

                            <h2>10. Continuously Learn and Improve</h2>
                            <h3>Reading and Webinars</h3>
                            <p>Read books, watch educational materials, and take trading courses. Continuous learning
                                and skill development
                                significantly improve your chances of success in financial markets.</p>

                            <h3>Practice and Testing</h3>
                            <p>Regularly test new strategies on a demo account and adapt to changing market conditions.
                                Consistent practice helps
                                you understand market behavior and refine your skills.</p>

                            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                            <p>By following these 10 tips, beginner traders can avoid common mistakes, learn to manage
                                risks, and gradually progress
                                toward success in financial markets. Successful trading is a combination of knowledge,
                                discipline, and continuous
