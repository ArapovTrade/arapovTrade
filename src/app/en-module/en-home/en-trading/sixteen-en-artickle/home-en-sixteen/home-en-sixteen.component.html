                    <h2 class="orange">Risk of Panic</h2>
                    <p>During a sharp change in exchange rates, panic may arise as many market participants (especially
                        small speculators)
                        start to panic and spontaneously close their positions to avoid losing profit or to reduce
                        losses. Such actions lead
                        to even greater changes in the exchange rate. This creates a snowball effect: the more positions
                        are closed, the
                        more the price changes, and the stronger the panic becomes. Simultaneously, many participants
                        begin to open
                        positions in the direction of the price movement, hoping to quickly make a profit, and the
                        exchange rate continues
                        to move rapidly.</p>
                    <p>A sharp change in exchange rates can be caused by various factors such as the release of
                        important financial news or
                        the actions of large players, such as national banks of different countries. They influence the
                        change in exchange
                        rates by selling or buying large volumes of currency. Sharp changes in exchange rates can
                        generate rumors that have
                        no real basis.</p>
                    <p>To reduce such risks, it is recommended not to open trades during the period of expecting
                        important news releases. It
                        is important to constantly analyze the movement of the exchange rate to understand what caused
                        this movement, use
                        protective orders (take-profit and stop-loss), trade according to your own system, and strictly
                        adhere to it.</p>
