                    <h1 class="orange">How to Choose a Timeframe for Trading on the Stock Exchange</h1>
                    <p>The choice of trading period depends on several conditions, but the first and foremost is the
                        trading strategy of a
                        particular trader, of which there are several types:</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Scalping:</h3>
                    <p>A strategy focused on making a large number of quick trades, with the closing period ranging from
                        a few seconds to a
                        few minutes. The strategy involves using the shortest timeframes: one-minute (M1) and
                        five-minute (M5).</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Intraday, or day trading</h3>
                    <p>This strategy involves making trades within a single trading day, although their number is
                        significantly less
                        compared to scalping. The duration of one trade ranges from a few minutes to a few hours.
                        Traders who use this
                        strategy usually use timeframes from five minutes (M5) to one hour (H1).</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Medium-term strategy</h3>
                    <p>This approach involves making longer trades, from one day to a week. Traders who choose this
                        strategy most often
                        analyze charts with timeframes from one hour (H1) to one day (D1).</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Long-term trading</h3>
                    <p>The least intensive but long-lasting and potentially profitable strategy, which is more like
                        investing than active
                        trading. Trades within the long-term strategy usually last at least a week or longer. In this
                        case, large timeframes
                        are used, starting from one day (D1) to several months (MN).</p>
                    <p>It is important to understand that by limiting the analysis to one or two timeframes, the trader
                        misses a lot of
                        information for analysis. Charts on different timeframes can show different price behavior. For
                        example, an analysis
                        on a five-minute chart may show "bullish" signals for opening a long position. However,
                        technical analysis on an
                        hourly or longer timeframe may indicate the approach of the instrument to a local price maximum,
                        which may be
                        followed by a pullback.</p>
