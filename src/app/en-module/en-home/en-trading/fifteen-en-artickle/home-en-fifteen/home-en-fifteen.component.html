                                directly influencing currency
                                pair dynamics. Their actions,
                                such as interest rate changes, currency interventions, and quantitative easing programs,
                                often lead to significant

                                The primary goal of central banks on FOREX is to maintain the stability of their
                                national currencies, prevent high
                                inflation, and create conditions for sustainable economic growth. Let’s explore how
                                central banks impact various
                                aspects of FOREX trading.

                            <h3>Main Tools Used by Central Banks</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Interest Rates:</strong> Central banks set benchmark interest rates, which
                                    determine the cost of
                                    borrowing in an economy. Raising rates can strengthen a currency by attracting
                                    foreign investment, while
                                    lowering rates may weaken it.</li>
                                <li><strong>Currency Interventions:</strong> Central banks may buy or sell their own
                                    currency in the market to keep
                                    its value within desired limits.</li>
                                <li><strong>Quantitative Easing (QE):</strong> Buying assets in the open market to
                                    increase money supply and
                                    stimulate the economy often leads to currency devaluation.</li>
                                <li><strong>Statements and Forecasts:</strong> Announcements from central bank leaders
                                    and economic projections
                                    significantly impact market sentiment.</li>

                                After European markets close, the American session becomes less active. However, Friday
                                evenings before the weekend
                                often see volatility spikes.

                            <h3>The Importance of Trading Sessions for Traders</h3>
                            <p>
                                Understanding the workings of trading sessions and the influence of central banks allows
                                traders to develop more
                                effective strategies. For instance, traders can use the low volatility of the Asian
                                session to open long-term
                                positions, while the high activity of the European and American sessions can be
                                leveraged for quick profit
                                opportunities.
