                                <p>
                                    Iceberg orders are a special type of limit orders used by
                                    banks, <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/marketmaker">market makers</a>
                                    and
                                    institutional
                                    investors to
                                    mask
                                    their trading intentions. This type of order got its name because of its
                                    structure: the visible part of the order
                                    is only a small fraction of the total volume, while the main part
                                    remains hidden from the eyes of retail traders.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Hidden orders are a powerful tool for <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/smartestmoney">Smart Money</a>,
                                    allowing them to
                                    accumulate or
                                    distribute
                                    large positions without significant impact on market price. They are used in
                                    stock,
                                    forex, and cryptocurrency markets to manage large volumes without attracting
                                    attention
                                    from competitors
                                    and retail participants.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Why are Iceberg Orders Used?</h3>
                                <p>
                                    The main goal of hidden orders is to avoid market impact and panic that could
                                    arise,
                                    if the entire volume of the trade became visible at once. If a large player, such as
                                    an investment bank, wants
                                    to buy or sell a large volume of an asset, publishing this order in the order book
                                    could trigger
                                    a sharp price movement, which is unfavorable for Smart Money.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Unlike standard limit or market orders, Iceberg Orders are broken down into
                                    smaller portions,
                                    allowing institutional traders to trade quietly and avoid sharp
                                    price movements.
                                </p>

                                <h3>How Do Iceberg Orders Work?</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Order splitting. The entire order is split into several parts, and only a small
                                        visible part is displayed on the market.</li>
                                    <li>Automatic execution. When the visible volume is executed, the exchange
                                        automatically
                                        places the next part
                                        of the order.</li>
                                    <li>Minimizing slippage. Iceberg Orders reduce the price impact of a large
                                        order, avoiding market noise.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Creating the illusion of market demand or supply. Since the iceberg order is not
                                        fully visible, it can
                                        mislead other traders.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    Iceberg Orders are widely used in highly liquid markets, such as <a
                                        class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/forexmarket">Forex</a>,
                                    stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ), as
                                    well as cryptocurrency exchanges (Binance, Kraken, OKX).
                                    Their main purpose is to mask market activity, allowing large players to work with
                                    liquidity
                                    without attracting the crowd's attention.

                                <h2>Why Do Banks Use Hidden Orders?</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Large financial institutions, such as commercial banks, hedge funds, and
                                    institutional investors,
                                    manage billions of dollars. Unlike retail traders, they cannot
                                    simply enter or exit
                                    the market by placing a regular order, as their volumes are too large. Placing
                                    large orders openly
                                    can lead to sharp price changes, trigger market panic, or attract the attention
                                    of competitors.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Iceberg Orders solve this problem by allowing banks to break up their large trades
                                    into smaller pieces
                                    and execute them gradually, minimizing the impact on the asset's price and
                                    avoiding unwanted market
                                    movements.
                                </p>

                                <h3>Main Reasons for Using Iceberg Orders:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Maintaining anonymity:</strong> Hidden orders allow large
                                        market participants to work with
                                        large positions without revealing their intentions.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Avoiding slippage:</strong> Gradual execution of the order
                                        helps minimize price
                                        slippage that could occur during sharp price movements.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Liquidity manipulation:</strong> Iceberg Orders allow for liquidity
                                        to be collected at key
                                        levels, creating artificial demand or supply zones.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Preventing market influence:</strong> Placing large orders
                                        without hiding their volume can
                                        provoke speculative trades, negatively affecting the execution of
                                        Smart Money strategies.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Control over price movement:</strong> Iceberg Orders allow
                                        institutional players to carefully
                                        distribute positions without causing sharp market impulses.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>
                                    The use of hidden orders is an important part of the Smart Money strategy. They
                                    allow banks to effectively
                                    manage large capital, avoiding panic and excessive volatility.
                                    Understanding how Iceberg Orders work helps traders analyze
                                    market liquidity and find
                                    key levels where banks accumulate or distribute positions.

                                <p>
                                    Although iceberg orders are designed to mask large positions and minimize
                                    market impact,
                                    experienced traders, market makers, and algorithmic systems can detect their
                                    presence using
                                    advanced liquidity analysis tools. Detecting hidden orders helps
                                    identify levels
                                    where banks and institutional investors accumulate or distribute positions.

                                        <strong>Order Book Analysis:</strong>
                                        If limit orders at a certain level keep getting updated despite partial
                                        execution,
                                        it may indicate a hidden order. Banks and funds place orders
                                        in small parts to avoid
                                        attracting attention.

                                        <strong>Tick Volume Analysis:</strong>
                                        Under normal conditions, when large orders are executed, the volume should
                                        sharply
                                        decrease. However, if the price
                                        stays at one level and orders keep coming in, it’s a sign of Iceberg Orders.

                                        Cluster charts allow you to see abnormal volume behavior – recurring orders

                                        which prevent the price from breaking above or below.

                                        not change
                                        or continues to "stall",
                                        it may indicate the presence of a hidden limit order.

                                        If there is an imbalance of market buyers or sellers at one level,
                                        but the price remains
                                        stable,
                                        it is possible that institutional players are secretly absorbing liquidity
                                        using iceberg orders.

                                        disappear in fractions of a second – this can also be detected through

                                    false breakouts, analyze
                                    true demand and supply zones,
                                    and follow the large players rather than against them. By using liquidity analysis,
                                    order book analysis, and
                                    cluster charts,

                                    If you detect an Iceberg Order, this could be a signal that the level
                                    is acting as a strong
                                    demand or supply zone,
                                    and the price is likely unable to break through it immediately.

                                        <strong>Trading from hidden volume levels:</strong>
                                        If the price halts at a certain level despite strong pressure, it could indicate
                                        that Smart Money is holding positions. In such cases, entering a trade in
                                        the direction of the large player can be beneficial.

                                        <strong>Using volume analysis:</strong>
                                        Compare the volume at the level with the price movement. If, with increasing
                                        volume, the price does not
                                        break the level,
                                        it's likely that a hidden <a class="linkrefinto"

                                        of success.

                                        <strong>Following large players:</strong>
                                        Instead of trying to trade against Smart Money, it is more profitable
                                        to go in the same
                                        direction.
                                        If large limit orders are defending a level, there is a high probability
                                        of reversal or trend continuation in
                                        their direction.

                                <h2>Examples of Iceberg Orders in the Market</h2>
                                <p>
                                    Hidden orders (Iceberg Orders) are an important tool for large players such
                                    as banks, market makers, and
                                    hedge funds,
                                    allowing them to mask their trades and minimize the impact on the asset price.
                                    Let’s look at examples of how they are used in real markets and how they can
                                    be detected.
                                </p>

                                <h3>1. Example of Price Support with a Large Limit Order</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Imagine that the price of an asset is approaching an important support level, and a
                                    significant
                                    amount of market sell orders appears at this level.
                                    However, despite the pressure from sellers, the price does not fall and continues to
                                    hold
                                    in a narrow range.
                                    This could indicate the presence of a hidden limit order by Smart Money that
                                    absorbs market sell orders,
                                    creating a support level.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>How does it work?</strong>
                                    - Large players place an iceberg order to buy, breaking it into smaller parts so as
                                    not to attract
                                    attention.
                                    - Once a portion of the order is executed, the next part is automatically placed on
                                    the market,
                                    continuing to hold
                                    the price.
                                    - When Smart Money accumulates enough liquidity, they initiate an upward movement.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>How to use it?</strong>
                                    - If the price holds at the support level with high volumes, it could be a
                                    signal to enter a long position
                                    (buy).
                                    - Check the order book and cluster analysis to see if the level is being held by
                                    hidden limit
                                    orders.
                                </p>

                                <h3>2. Masking Large Sales at a Resistance Level</h3>
                                <p>
                                    Iceberg Orders are also used to exit large positions without strong price impact.
                                    For example, imagine that the price is testing a key resistance level, and
                                    retail traders are expecting a breakout.
                                    However, despite active buying, the price cannot break above — this could be
                                    a sign of a hidden limit order
                                    to sell.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>How does it work?</strong>
                                    - Large players place a hidden order to sell, creating the appearance of demand.
                                    - When buyers start to actively enter the market, their orders are absorbed by
                                    hidden
                                    orders, but the price does not rise.
                                    - Eventually, buyers exhaust the liquidity, and then Smart Money
                                    initiates a downward movement.
                                </p>

                                    <strong>How to use it?</strong>
                                    - If the resistance level is not broken, despite high buying volumes, it could be a
                                    sign
                                    of hidden orders.
                                    - Analyze the tick volume and order book to detect artificial price holding.
                                    - Enter a short position after confirming that the hidden order is
                                    holding back the price rise.
                                </p>

                                    increases.
                                    At these moments, Smart Money uses Iceberg Orders to accumulate or distribute
                                    positions.

                                    <strong>How does it work?</strong>
                                    - Large players may artificially drive the price up or down before the news release.
                                    - After the announcement, a sharp move is created, triggering stop orders from
                                    retail
                                    traders.
                                    - Once enough liquidity is collected, Smart Money reverses the price in the desired
                                    direction.

                                    <strong>How to use it?</strong>
                                    - Avoid entering the market right after important news releases.
                                    - Wait for the price to stabilize and analyze the volumes to detect hidden
                                    orders.
                                    - Use order-flow analysis and the order book to detect Iceberg Orders.

                                <h3>4. Market Manipulation through Iceberg Orders</h3>
                                <p>
                                    In some cases, hidden orders are used to create false movements and collect
                                    liquidity.
                                    For example, Smart Money may create the illusion of strong demand or supply to
                                    lure retail traders into the wrong position.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>How does it work?</strong>
                                    - A hidden order to buy or sell is placed, creating the impression of market
                                    interest.
                                    - When the crowd gets involved and starts buying/selling, large players cancel
                                    their orders and reverse
                                    the market.
                                    - As a result, retail traders end up with losses, and Smart Money gets
                                    favorable prices for their positions.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>How to use it?</strong>
                                    - Watch for discrepancies between price movements and volumes.
                                    - Analyze the order book: if large orders suddenly disappear, it could
                                    be manipulation.
                                    - Avoid entering the market on emotional movements without confirmation of real
                                    demand/supply.
                                </p>

                                    Iceberg Orders are a powerful tool for Smart Money, allowing them to hide
                                    large positions, avoid
                                    market impact, and manipulate liquidity.
                                    Traders who do not consider this factor often find themselves in unfavorable
                                    situations, trading against large
                                    players.
