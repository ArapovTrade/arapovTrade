                    <h1 class="orange">What Timeframe is Best for a Beginner to Trade On</h1>
                    <p>Often, beginner traders, who have no idea what timeframe to trade on, start experimenting with
                        different trading
                        periods. This approach is not without merit â€” traders themselves determine the timeframe they
                        are comfortable
                        working with. It happens that, based on this principle, a beginner eventually chooses a trading
                        strategy. Despite
                        the fact that this approach may disrupt the logical sequence of actions, it has an undeniable
                        advantage: the
                        beginner trader selects a strategy and timeframe based on their own experiences rather than
                        someone else's advice.
                    </p>
                    <p>Of course, it's worth noting that the size of the timeframe is related to the duration of the
                        potential trade. If you
                        plan to close a trade 15 minutes after opening it, there is no point in focusing on a daily
                        chart.</p>
                    <p>It happens that beginners start randomly jumping from one timeframe to another, making hasty
                        forecasts, which in most
                        cases ends in losses and disappointment in trading. To avoid such situations, there are a number
                        of recommendations
                        that will help a beginner trader determine the right timeframe for their goals.</p>
