                    </h1>


                    <p>Working in the FOREX market means the need to stay constantly updated on business events. The
                        subject of fundamental
                        analysis includes the following factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>economic indicators published by information agencies and statistical bodies in the form of
                            reports on absolute
                            indicators and indexes. The time of announcement of these indicators is always known in
                            advance and indicated in
                            special economic calendars, so they belong to the group of expected factors. Of particular
                            importance are
                            indicators of the US economy, inflation, and unemployment levels;</li>
                        <li>news and events, which are divided into expected or planned (economic, political news) and
                            unexpected or random
                            (political, natural, force majeure events). Expected news has a strong impact on the market
                            even before it
                            appears, as the rule "buy on rumors, sell on facts" works. Unexpected news has a short life
                            cycle but impacts
                            the market much more strongly as it is not anticipated.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="orange">There are two life cycle options for fundamental factors:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a short life cycle ranging from one day to several days, typical of unexpected news and
                            rumors;</li>
                        <li>a long life cycle lasting from several weeks to several years, characteristic of general
                            macroeconomic
                            indicators and political news.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Rumors cause a chain reaction among market participants — everyone rushes to make a deal. When a
                        rumor appears, a new
                        powerful wave emerges in the market, which acts until the rumor is confirmed or refuted — after
                        this, the reverse
                        movement of the exchange rate occurs, as the main thing is to "jump off the train" before the
                        new trend starts. The
                        most common rumor is the expectation of a change in the discount rate. The expectation of rising
                        interest rates
                        means an increase in the national currency rate.</p>
                    <p class="orange">The impact of fundamental factors causes one of the possible market reactions upon
                        announcement:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>if market expectations are generally met, there will be no significant change in rate
                            dynamics;</li>
                        <li>if market expectations are not met because the factor was underestimated, the current trend
                            will continue with a
                            possible acceleration at the moment the news appears;</li>
                        <li>if market expectations are fundamentally wrong, a reversal of the market direction is
                            possible. As a rule, when
                            news appears, the market freezes for a while, understanding what is happening. During this
                            time, major market
                            participants "hold" the rate to have time to close previously opened positions that have
                            become unprofitable and
                            open positions in the other direction;</li>
                        <li>if fundamental news contradicts the current trend, its impact on the market will be
                            short-term;</li>
                        <li>if fundamental news confirms the current trend, the market movement accelerates, but the
                            likelihood of a
                            rollback increases.</li>
                    </ul>
