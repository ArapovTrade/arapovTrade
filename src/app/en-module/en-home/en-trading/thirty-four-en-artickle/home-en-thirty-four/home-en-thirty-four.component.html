                    <p>A stop-limit order is a combination of two types of orders: stop and limit. It specifies two
                        prices: the limit price
                        and the stop price, which may be the same or different. If the market price reaches the stop
                        price, a limit order is
                        placed.</p>
                    <p>Generally, stop-limit orders are used to control the amount of slippage on stop orders when
                        entering a position on a
                        breakout of a set level (remember, a regular stop order executes with arbitrary slippage).</p>
                    <p>A stop-limit order does not guarantee the execution of the trade even if the price touches the
                        stop price (since the
                        limit order might not trigger). For this reason, it is not recommended to use a stop-limit order
                        to exit a position
                        to limit losses (stop loss). Additionally, not all brokers accept this type of trading order.
