                    <p>To start trading on the currency market today, you need a reliable broker, a computer, and
                        Internet access. So, to

                        services. A reliable
                        broker provides good trading conditions (the ability to open a demo or cent account with a
                        minimal deposit, low
                        spread, no commission, leverage from 1:1 to 1:500, fast execution of trading orders, a large
                        number of instruments —
                        currency pairs for trading).</p>

                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3 class="orange">It is worth remembering</h3>
                    <p>Trading on the currency market is a difficult and stressful job that should be approached
                        with all seriousness
                        and responsibility. To make trading on Forex a source of constant and stable income, it is not
                        enough to just
                        understand the trading terminal, you need to constantly learn, not only in training courses and
                        books but also
                        through your own experience. You need to accumulate knowledge and skills, studying new trading
                        strategies,
                        developing your own trading strategy or system, and constantly improving, supplementing, and
                        perfecting it.</p>

                    <p>To start, it is worth studying the basics of technical and fundamental analysis; this will allow
                        you to understand
                        what affects the price, learn to read charts, and make accurate forecasts of future price
                        movements. It is also
                        worth studying theories of capital management and the psychological aspects of trading on the
                        exchange; this will
                        significantly reduce the risk of transactions and make decisions based on rational analysis
                        rather than emotional
                        outbursts. Constant development and learning will allow you to earn steadily and a lot in the
                        future.</p>
