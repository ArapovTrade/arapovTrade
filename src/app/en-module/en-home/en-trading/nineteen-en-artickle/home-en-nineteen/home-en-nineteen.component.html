                            <h2>What is FOREX and How Does It Work?</h2>
                            <p>
                                <strong>FOREX</strong> (<em>Foreign Exchange Market</em>) is the <strong>international
                                    currency
                                    market</strong>,
                                the largest in the world. Daily turnover on FOREX exceeds <strong>$6 trillion</strong>.
                                This market
                                facilitates
                                trading of currencies from different countries to profit from exchange rate
                                fluctuations. A key feature of
                                FOREX is its accessibility to all participants, from banks to private traders.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Unlike stock exchanges, FOREX operates 24/7. Trading starts with the <strong>Asian
                                    session</strong> on
                                Monday
                                and ends with the <strong>American session</strong> on Friday. This allows traders from
                                around the world to
                                choose a convenient time for trading. For example:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Asian session:</strong> Active currency pairs include the Japanese yen
                                    (USD/JPY).</li>
                                <li><strong>European session:</strong> Dominated by the euro (EUR/USD) and British pound
                                    (GBP/USD).</li>
                                <li><strong>American session:</strong> High volatility due to the activity of the US
                                    dollar (USD).</li>
                            </ul>

                            <p>
                                <strong>Trading on FOREX</strong> is an accessible and convenient way to profit from
                                currency rate fluctuations. To
                                start, you need to follow several key steps that will ensure a successful start and
                                minimize risks. Here's what to
                                consider:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Choose a reliable broker:</strong> Research reviews and ratings, paying
                                    attention to
                                    <strong>licenses</strong> (e.g., CySEC, FCA), trading conditions, spread size,
                                    available platforms, and customer
                                    support. For example, check the speed of order execution and the availability of
                                    educational materials.
                                    <p>Tip: Opt for a broker with a demo account to safely test the platform and
                                        strategies.</p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Create a trading account:</strong> Registration on the broker's platform
                                    requires entering personal
                                    information and completing verification. This process is essential for the security
                                    of your funds and compliance
                                    with international regulations.
                                    <p>Example: Prepare documents such as a passport and proof of address to speed up
                                        the registration process.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Install a trading platform:</strong> Popular platforms like
                                    <strong>MetaTrader 4/5</strong> or cTrader
                                    offer powerful analytical tools, charts, and indicators. They also support mobile
                                    apps, allowing you to trade
                                    from any device.
                                    <p>Tip: Before starting, familiarize yourself with the platform interface to
                                        effectively utilize all its
                                        features.
                                    </p>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    <strong>Fund your account:</strong> Deposit the minimum amount required by your
                                    broker. The deposit size depends
                                    on the company's conditions, but many brokers allow you to start with as little as
                                    <strong>$10</strong>. For a
                                    more confident start, it is recommended to use a deposit of at least
                                    <strong>$500</strong> to have more
                                    flexibility in risk management.
                                    <p>Tip: Use a funding method that supports fast transfers and low fees, such as bank

                            <p>
                                Successful trading on <strong>FOREX</strong> begins with selecting a suitable strategy
                                that matches your
                                style, experience, and financial goals. Here are some of the most popular strategies
                                used by professional
                                traders:
                            </p>

                            <h3>1. Scalping</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong> <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/scalpingintrading">Scalping</a>
                                </strong> is a high-frequency strategy that involves opening
                                multiple short-term trades within a trading day. The goal is to gain small but
                                consistent profits from minor price
                                movements. This approach requires
                                high concentration and quick decision-making.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Example:</strong> Buying the EUR/USD pair during a 10-pip increase and selling
                                it immediately for a minimal
                                profit. Scalpers often rely on tight spreads and fast order execution.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Tip:</strong> Choose a broker with low commissions and use a trading platform
                                with automation features to
                                streamline the process.
                            </p>
                            <h3>2. Day Trading</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Day Trading</strong> involves opening and closing all positions within a single
                                trading day, eliminating
                                risks associated with carrying trades overnight. This strategy suits traders who are
                                prepared to actively monitor
                                the market.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep an eye on the economic calendar and news, as major events
                                like GDP reports or central
                                bank decisions can cause sharp price movements. Use indicators such as trading volume
                                and moving averages to
                                analyze intraday price action.
                            </p>

                            <h3>3. Trend Trading</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Trend Trading</strong> focuses on analyzing price direction and opening
                                positions in line with it. The
                                main principle is "The trend is your friend." This method allows traders to benefit from
                                prolonged market
                                movements.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Example:</strong> If the GBP/USD pair shows consistent growth over a week, the
                                trader opens a long
                                position. Indicators like MACD and RSI can help identify trends.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Tip:</strong> Use support and resistance levels to accurately identify entry and
                                exit points to maximize
                                profits.
                            </p>

                            <h3>4. Position Trading</h3>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Position Trading</strong> is oriented towards long-term price movements. Traders
                                hold positions for weeks
                                or even months, focusing on global macroeconomic trends.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Example:</strong> Buying the USD/JPY currency pair based on a forecast of a
                                strengthening US dollar due to
                                Federal Reserve interest rate hikes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Tip:</strong> Use fundamental analysis to assess economic factors such as
                                inflation, interest rates, and
                                labor market conditions.
                            </p>

                            <h3>5. Breakout Trading</h3>
                            <p>
                                This strategy is based on trading during moments of <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/levelbreakoutstrategy">breakout</a> of
                                key support or
                                resistance levels. Breakouts are often accompanied by high volatility and increased
                                trading volumes.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Example:</strong> If the EUR/USD pair breaks a resistance level, the trader
                                opens a long position expecting
                                further growth.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                <strong>Tip:</strong> Ensure the breakout is genuine by checking trading volumes. Use <a

                                risks associated with false
                                breakouts.

                            <p>
                                Choosing a strategy on <strong>FOREX</strong> should be based on your goals, available
                                time, and risk tolerance.
                                Experiment on a demo account to determine which strategy works best for you.

                            <p>
                                Trading on FOREX is an attractive opportunity to earn money, but it comes with high
                                risks. Understanding the
                                potential threats and methods to minimize them is a crucial step toward successful
                                market operations.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Main Risks</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Risk of Losing Your Deposit:</strong> Trading without a clear plan and risk
                                    management can lead to a
                                    total loss of capital. Set loss limits (stop-losses) and do not risk more than 1–2%
                                    of your deposit per trade.
                                </li>

                                    High leverage attracts traders, but it also increases the likelihood of significant
                                    losses. For example, 1:100
                                    leverage can double the loss with just a 1% market movement. Use moderate leverage
                                    ratios, such as 1:10 or 1:20.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Market Volatility:</strong> The FOREX market is prone to sharp price
                                    fluctuations due to news, economic
                                    data, or political events. Prepare for these movements by regularly monitoring the

                            <p>
                                Applying the following methods can help you effectively manage risks and avoid
                                significant losses:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Diversify your positions:</strong> Do not invest all your capital in a
                                    single currency pair. Spread it
                                    across multiple assets to reduce dependence on one instrument.</li>
                                <li><strong>Use protective orders:</strong> Set stop-loss and take-profit orders to
                                    automatically lock in losses and
                                    profits. This helps avoid emotional decisions and preserves your deposit.</li>
                                <li><strong>Stay updated on news:</strong> Important economic reports, such as inflation
                                    data or interest rate
                                    decisions, can cause sharp market movements. Prepare for these changes by adjusting
                                    your positions in advance.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Evaluate the expected value:</strong> Before every trade, calculate the

                                    <strong>Practice on a demo account:</strong> Use a demo account to master the
                                    trading platform, test strategies,
                                    and understand market features without risking real capital. This is especially

                                    <strong>Keep a trading journal:</strong> Record every trade, including the date,
                                    time, asset, position size,
                                    reason for opening, and outcome. By analyzing these records, you can identify
                                    mistakes, improve strategies, and
                                    avoid repeating them.
                                    <p>Example: If you notice you often close trades too early, review your
                                        profit-taking strategy.</p>

                                    <strong>Start small:</strong> Avoid investing large amounts at the beginning. Start
                                    with a minimal deposit to reduce
                                    risks and focus on learning. Gradually increase your capital as your skills grow.
                                    <p>Tip: Use the 80/20 rule — allocate 80% of your capital to low-risk investments
                                        and 20% to active trading.</p>

                                    <strong>Keep up with the news:</strong> Use an economic calendar to analyze events
                                    that could impact the market. For
                                    instance, reports on unemployment rates, GDP data, and central bank decisions can
                                    cause significant market
                                    movements.
                                    <p>Recommendation: Set up alerts for major news to stay informed about key
                                        developments.</p>
