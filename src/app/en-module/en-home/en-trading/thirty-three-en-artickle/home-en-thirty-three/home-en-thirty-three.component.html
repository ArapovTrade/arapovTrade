                  <h2>Understanding the Requote Phenomenon</h2>
                  <p>
                    Every trader eventually encounters a frustrating scenario:
                    you spot the perfect entry, click the buy button, and
                    instead of instant execution, a message appears informing
                    you that the price has changed. This situation is known as a
                    <dfn itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/DefinedTerm"
                      ><span itemprop="name">requote</span></dfn
                    >
                    — a broker's notification that your requested price is no
                    longer available, along with an offer to execute at a
                    different price. To understand this topic more deeply, I
                    recommend studying
                    <a
                      class="linkrefinto"
                      href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/marketorder"
                      >market order</a
                    >.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    The mechanism behind requotes stems from the inherent time
                    gap between order submission and execution. When you send a
                    trading request, it travels through your internet connection
                    to the broker's server, gets processed by their system, and
                    is then routed to liquidity providers. This entire journey
                    takes anywhere from a few milliseconds to a full second.
                    During this brief window, market prices can shift
                    significantly, especially in fast-moving conditions.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Financial markets operate as continuous ecosystems where
                    millions of participants worldwide execute trades
                    simultaneously. Economic releases influence investor
                    sentiment, algorithmic systems process thousands of
                    transactions per second, and geopolitical events trigger
                    instant price reactions. In this environment, asset prices —
                    whether currency pairs, stocks, or cryptocurrencies — remain
                    in constant flux.

                    measures the intensity of these price movements and directly
                    correlates with requote probability.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Brokers cannot guarantee execution at prices that no longer
                    exist in the market. Instead of filling your order at an
                    outdated quote, they send a requote notification with the
                    current available price. You then decide whether to accept
                    the new terms or cancel the trade entirely. This key
                    distinction separates requotes from
                    <dfn itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/DefinedTerm"
                      ><span itemprop="name">slippage</span></dfn
                    >, where orders execute automatically at different prices
                    without requesting confirmation.

                  <h2>Primary Causes of Requotes</h2>
                  <p>
                    Identifying the root causes empowers traders to develop
                    effective strategies for reducing requote frequency. Several
                    key factors contribute to this common trading challenge.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Economic data releases create prime conditions for requotes.
                    Employment reports, central bank interest rate decisions,
                    inflation figures, and GDP announcements can move prices by
                    dozens of pips within seconds. During these events, order
                    flow surges dramatically while prices shift faster than
                    execution systems can process requests. Traders attempting
                    to enter positions during such moments frequently encounter
                    requotes as brokers struggle to match orders with available
                    liquidity.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Technical infrastructure plays a crucial role in execution
                    quality. Your internet connection speed directly affects
                    data transmission time. Unstable WiFi or mobile connections
                    with high latency increase the delay between clicking the
                    order button and the broker receiving your request. Every
                    additional millisecond raises the probability of price
                    changes before execution. Experienced traders address this
                    challenge by renting
                    <dfn itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/DefinedTerm"
                      ><span itemprop="name">VPS servers</span></dfn
                    >
                    located near their broker's data centers, reducing
                    transmission time to near-instantaneous levels.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Broker business models significantly impact execution
                    quality. A fundamental difference exists between
                    <dfn itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/DefinedTerm"
                      ><span itemprop="name">Dealing Desk</span></dfn
                    >
                    brokers and those offering direct market access. Dealing
                    Desk brokers process client orders internally, often acting
                    as counterparties to trades. This creates potential
                    conflicts of interest — your profit might represent their
                    loss. Such brokers may delay execution or offer less
                    favorable requotes during adverse price movements.
                    <dfn itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/DefinedTerm"
                      ><span itemprop="name">ECN brokers</span></dfn
                    >
                    route orders directly to the interbank market, where major
                    financial institutions provide execution. This model
                    eliminates the inherent conflict between broker and client
                    interests.
                  </p>

                    determines market depth and the ability to fill large orders
                    without significant price impact. Major currency pairs like
                    EUR/USD and GBP/USD feature massive liquidity with daily
                    volumes measured in trillions of dollars. Requotes occur
                    less frequently on these instruments because counterparties
                    are always available. Exotic pairs or small-cap stocks trade
                    in much thinner volumes, increasing the likelihood that
                    requested prices become unavailable before execution
                    completes.

                  <h2>Impact of Requotes on Trading Performance</h2>
                  <p>
                    The consequences of frequent requotes extend beyond mere
                    inconvenience. They affect financial results, psychological
                    state, and overall trading system effectiveness.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    From a financial perspective, each requote potentially
                    represents a missed opportunity or deteriorated entry
                    conditions. Consider this scenario: technical analysis
                    signals a reversal pattern forming, you submit a buy order,
                    but receive a requote five pips higher than your intended
                    entry. Accepting the new price reduces your potential profit
                    and worsens your risk-to-reward ratio. Declining the trade
                    means completely missing the opportunity while watching the
                    market move in your anticipated direction.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Scalpers and intraday traders working with small target
                    moves face particular vulnerability. A strategy designed to
                    capture 10-15 pip movements becomes unprofitable when
                    entries consistently worsen by 4-5 pips due to requotes. The
                    cumulative effect over a month of active trading can amount
                    to substantial sums.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Psychological impact deserves equal attention. A series of
                    requotes triggers frustration and can provoke emotional
                    decision-making. Traders begin rushing entries, accepting
                    unfavorable prices, or entering positions without proper
                    justification. This behavior contradicts disciplined trading
                    principles and typically leads to increased losses.

                  <h2>Effective Strategies for Reducing Requotes</h2>
                  <p>
                    Completely eliminating requotes is impossible — they
                    represent a natural aspect of market mechanics. However, a
                    thoughtful approach significantly reduces their frequency
                    and minimizes their impact on trading results.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Broker selection deserves careful analysis. Research reviews
                    on independent forums and professional communities. Examine
                    claimed execution speeds and slippage statistics. Regulated
                    brokers holding licenses from reputable authorities — FCA,
                    ASIC, CySEC — must adhere to fair execution standards. Test
                    platforms on demo accounts during high volatility periods to
                    assess real-world system behavior before committing capital.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <dfn itemscope itemtype="https://schema.org/DefinedTerm"

                    >
                    serve as effective tools against requotes. When setting
                    limit or stop orders, you predetermine the exact execution
                    price. Once the market reaches your specified level, the
                    order activates automatically without requiring
                    confirmation. This approach proves especially valuable for
                    trading around key support and resistance levels where
                    precise entry matters most.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Technical optimization encompasses several aspects. Use
                    wired ethernet connections instead of wireless — this
                    reduces latency and eliminates interference. Check your ping
                    to the broker's server: values exceeding 100 milliseconds
                    signal the need for improvements. For serious trading,
                    consider renting a VPS in the same data center housing your
                    broker's servers. Many providers offer trading-optimized
                    servers with sub-millisecond latency for monthly fees
                    starting around fifteen dollars.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Planning trades around the economic calendar helps avoid the
                    riskiest periods. High-impact events — rate decisions,
                    employment reports, GDP data — create volatility spikes.
                    Refrain from opening new positions ten minutes before and
                    after such releases. If news trading forms part of your
                    strategy, increase the acceptable price deviation range in
                    your terminal settings and reduce position sizes
                    accordingly.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    Session timing also affects requote probability. Maximum
                    liquidity occurs during the European and American session
                    overlap. During these hours,

                    narrow to their tightest levels, and market depth
                    accommodates rapid execution of large orders. Night hours
                    and holiday periods feature reduced activity and elevated
                    requote risk. Asian session trading of European pairs, for
                    instance, often encounters wider spreads and more frequent
                    execution issues.

                  <p>
                    Brokerage firms serve as intermediaries between traders and
                    financial markets. Their technology, business model, and
                    liquidity provider relationships directly determine
                    execution quality.

                    creates potential conflicts: client profits may translate to

                    Brokers with direct market access route client orders to
                    liquidity pools comprised of major banks. They earn
                    commissions on each trade rather than profiting from client
                    losses, aligning their interests with yours. Top-tier
                    brokers maintain relationships with dozens of prime banks,

                  <h2>Adapting Your Trading Strategy to Requotes</h2>
                  <p>
                    Accepting requotes as part of market reality enables a
                    constructive approach to this phenomenon. Rather than

                    Define acceptable price deviation ranges in advance. If your
                    strategy allows entering trades two or three pips worse than
                    planned without critically damaging risk-reward ratios,
                    configure automatic requote acceptance within these limits.

                    Requotes can serve as market condition indicators. Receiving
                    price confirmation requests more frequently signals elevated
                    volatility or liquidity problems. Use this information to
                    adjust your trading plan: reduce position sizes, widen
                    stops, or temporarily pause trading until conditions
                    normalize.

                    Trading automation partially addresses requote challenges.
                    Trading robots can instantly respond to new price offers
                    according to predetermined parameters. Algorithms accept
                    requotes within defined limits or reject trades exceeding
                    acceptable deviation. This eliminates emotional components
                    and accelerates decision-making.

                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>
                    Requotes represent natural consequences of market dynamics
                    and the technical realities of order execution. They do not
                    constitute insurmountable obstacles to profitable trading
                    but require conscious approaches and intelligent strategy
                    adaptation.

                    Selecting a reliable broker with quality infrastructure
                    creates the foundation for comfortable trading. Using
                    pending orders, optimizing your technical setup, and
                    planning trades around the economic calendar allow you to
                    minimize requote frequency. Understanding the mechanisms
                    behind their occurrence helps maintain emotional balance and
                    make well-considered decisions even when facing execution
                    challenges. To consolidate this material, also study the

                    Every experienced trader has navigated the adaptation period
                    to market realities. Requotes are merely one of many factors
                    requiring consideration when building trading systems. A
                    systematic approach, discipline, and continuous skill
                    improvement enable you to transform a potential problem into
                    a manageable element of the trading process. Rather than
                    viewing requotes as failures, treat them as part of the
                    normal market landscape that successful traders learn to
                    navigate effectively.

                          What is a requote in trading?

                      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                      <p>
                        A requote occurs when a broker cannot execute your order
                        at the requested price and offers a new price instead.
                        This happens because market prices change rapidly
                        between the moment you submit an order and when the
                        broker processes it. You can accept the new price or
                        cancel the trade.

                      <p>
                        Main causes of requotes include: high market volatility
                        during news releases, slow internet connection or
                        latency issues, broker's order processing delays, low
                        liquidity of the trading instrument, and the broker's
                        execution model (Dealing Desk brokers tend to produce
                        more requotes than ECN/STP brokers).

                      <p>
                        To minimize requotes: choose ECN/STP brokers with fast
                        execution, use pending orders instead of market orders,
                        avoid trading during major news releases, improve your
                        internet connection or use a VPS server near your
                        broker's data center, and trade during high liquidity
                        sessions.

                          What is the difference between requote and

                      </mat-expansion-panel-header>
                      <p>
                        A requote asks for confirmation before executing at a
                        different price — you can decline. Slippage
                        automatically executes your order at a different price
                        without asking. With requotes you have a choice; with
                        slippage the trade is already done at the new price.

                        ECN or STP brokers with direct market access typically
                        provide fewer requotes. Look for brokers regulated by
                        reputable authorities (FCA, ASIC, CySEC), check
                        execution speed reviews, and test the platform on a demo
                        account during volatile periods before trading with real
                        money.
