                                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                                <p>Requotes occur when brokers suggest a different price for a trade after a trader
                                    submits an order.
                                    This situation is common in financial markets, particularly during high volatility.
                                    While requotes
                                    are a natural part of trading mechanisms, they often frustrate traders.</p>
                                <p>This article explains what requotes are, their causes, how to minimize their
                                    occurrence, and how to
                                    handle them effectively to maintain an efficient trading strategy.</p>

                                <h2>What Are Requotes?</h2>
                                <p>Requotes are a broker's repeated offer of a price after a trader's initial request
                                    for execution.
                                    This means the initial price is no longer available, and the broker proposes a new
                                    price for the
                                    trade. Requotes commonly happen in markets with high volatility, where prices can
                                    change within
                                    fractions of a second.</p>

                                <h3>Key Characteristics of Requotes:</h3>
                                <ul>
                                    <li><strong>Cause:</strong> Prices changed before the order could be executed.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Consequence:</strong> Delayed trade execution or missed trading
                                        opportunities.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Frequency:</strong> Depends on the broker's quality and market
                                        conditions.</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>Although requotes can be frustrating, it is important to understand that they are not
                                    always a sign
                                    of broker dishonesty. Often, they are a result of market dynamics.</p>

                                <h2>Reasons for Requotes</h2>
                                <p>There are several factors that can lead to requotes:</p>

                                <h3>1. High Volatility</h3>
                                <p>During important news events or the release of economic data, the market can move at
                                    a very high speed. This
                                    makes the price available a few seconds ago invalid, and the broker is forced to
                                    offer a new price.</p>

                                <h3>2. Order Execution Delays</h3>
                                <p>Delays in order processing on the broker's side or in the trader's internet
                                    connection can result in the price
                                    changing before the order is executed.</p>
                                <div class="flex">
                                    <img class="pictureImg" src="/assets/img/content/requotes2.webp"

                                </div>
                                <h3>3. Type of Order Execution</h3>
                                <p>Different brokers use different order execution models. For example, brokers with a
                                    Dealing Desk (DD) model are
                                    more likely to experience requotes because they process trades manually, unlike
                                    brokers with a Non-Dealing Desk
                                    (NDD) model.</p>

                                <h3>4. Lack of Liquidity</h3>
                                <p>In markets with low liquidity, the price can change quickly due to a lack of
                                    sufficient buyers or sellers. This
                                    can also result in requotes.</p>

                                <h2>How Do Requotes Affect Trading?</h2>
                                <p>Requotes can significantly impact trading results and the overall experience of
                                    working with a broker. Here are
                                    the main consequences:</p>

                                <h3>1. Missed Opportunities</h3>
                                <p>When a broker offers a new price, the trader may decline the trade if the price does
                                    not meet their expectations.
                                    This can result in missing out on profitable trading opportunities.</p>

                                <h3>2. Reduced Profit</h3>
                                <p>If the new price is less favorable than the requested one, it can decrease the
                                    trader's potential profit. For
                                    instance, when opening a trade with a planned profit, a price change may reduce this
                                    profit.</p>

                                <h3>3. Psychological Pressure</h3>
                                <p>Frequent requotes can cause frustration and affect the trader's emotional state,
                                    leading to impulsive decisions.
                                </p>

                                <h3>4. Increased Execution Time</h3>
                                <p>Requotes slow down the trading process, which is particularly critical in highly
                                    volatile markets where time is
                                    of the essence.</p>

                                <h2>How to Avoid Requotes?</h2>
                                <p>Although it is impossible to completely avoid requotes, there are several strategies
                                    that can help minimize their
                                    frequency:</p>

                                <h3>1. Choose a Reliable Broker</h3>
                                <p>Look for brokers with a minimal number of requotes. Trader reviews and ratings can
                                    help evaluate the quality of
                                    order execution.</p>

                                <h3>2. Use Pending Orders</h3>
                                <p>Pending orders allow you to set a price in advance at which the trade should be
                                    executed. This helps avoid
                                    execution at an unexpected price.</p>

                                <h3>3. Improve Internet Connection</h3>
                                <p>High-speed internet connections reduce delays and minimize the risk of requotes
                                    caused by technical issues.</p>

                                <h3>4. Avoid Trading During News Events</h3>
                                <p>During the release of significant news, the market becomes extremely volatile,
                                    increasing the likelihood of
                                    requotes. Avoid trading during these times.</p>

                                <h3>5. Choose the Right Trading Time</h3>
                                <p>Trade during the most liquid sessions (e.g., during the overlap of the European and
                                    American sessions) to reduce
                                    the risk of requotes.</p>

                                <h2>The Role of the Broker in Requotes</h2>
                                <p>The broker plays a key role in the frequency and impact of requotes. Traders need to
                                    understand how brokers
                                    operate and what conditions they offer to choose the right partner for trading.</p>

                                <h3>1. Execution Model</h3>
                                <p>Brokers with a Dealing Desk (DD) often provide requotes as they act as
                                    counter-parties in trades. NDD brokers
                                    (STP or ECN) typically pass trades directly to the market, reducing the likelihood
                                    of requotes.</p>

                                <h3>2. Liquidity Quality</h3>
                                <p>Brokers with access to high-quality liquidity providers can offer more stable prices,
                                    reducing the risk of
                                    requotes.</p>

                                <h3>3. Regulation</h3>
                                <p>Regulated brokers typically provide more transparent trading conditions and encounter
                                    requotes less frequently.
                                </p>

                                <h3>4. Technical Infrastructure</h3>
                                <p>Modern servers and technologies allow brokers to minimize delays in order execution,
                                    which also reduces the
                                    likelihood of requotes.</p>

                                <h2>How to Deal with Requotes?</h2>
                                <p>If you encounter requotes, it's essential to learn how to handle them effectively:
                                </p>

                                <h3>1. Accepting the New Price</h3>
                                <p>If the proposed price aligns with your strategy, you can accept it and proceed with
                                    the trade. It's important to
                                    establish an acceptable price deviation range beforehand.</p>

                                <h3>2. Waiting for the Right Moment</h3>
                                <p>If the new price doesn't meet your expectations, reject the trade and wait for a
                                    better opportunity to enter the
                                    market.</p>

                                <h3>3. Analyzing Market Conditions</h3>
                                <p>Regularly analyze the market to predict periods of high volatility and avoid them
                                    when possible.</p>

                                <h3>4. Using Automated Systems</h3>
                                <p>Trading robots and algorithms can help minimize human error and respond more quickly
                                    to market changes.</p>
