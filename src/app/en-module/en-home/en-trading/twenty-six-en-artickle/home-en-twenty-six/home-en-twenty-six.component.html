                    <p><strong class="orange">Technical analysis</strong> is the most common type of analysis because
                        most retail traders are not well-versed in economics
                        and how it affects the value of an asset, so they rely entirely on price charts and the analysis
                        of price quotes'
                        behavior, specifically their direction and range of movement. In this section, we will learn
                        about the main types of
                        price chart displays, how to build "support and resistance" levels (horizontal/trend), as well
                        as the main "price
                        patterns" - patterns that for many traders are the "entry point into the market".</p>

                    <p><strong class="orange">Technical analysis</strong> is the study of price charts to predict future
                        price movements.</p>

                        <li>It involves studying market behavior based solely on price information and its graphical
                            representations.</li>
                        <li>It is conducted to determine a trader's behavior in the market: whether to buy, sell a
                            financial instrument, or
                            stay out of the market, i.e., take no action.</li>
