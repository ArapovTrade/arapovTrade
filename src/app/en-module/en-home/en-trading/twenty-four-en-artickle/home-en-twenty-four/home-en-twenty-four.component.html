                                Fibonacci levels are one of the most popular tools in technical analysis, used by
                                traders to identify
                                reversal points, support and resistance zones, as well as to forecast further price
                                movements. These levels
                                are based on Fibonacci ratios and are widely applied in forex, stock trading, and
                                cryptocurrencies.

                            <h2>The Basics of Fibonacci Levels</h2>
                            <p>
                                The <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci sequence</a> ,
                                discovered by Leonardo Fibonacci, is a series of numbers where
                                each subsequent
                                number
                                is the sum of the previous two: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and so on. The ratios between
                                these numbers form
                                proportions used in technical analysis.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Key Fibonacci Levels</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>23.6%:</strong> The first correction level after a strong impulse.</li>
                                <li><strong>38.2%:</strong> A popular level for short-term trades.</li>
                                <li><strong>50%:</strong> A psychological level that helps determine market balance.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>61.8%:</strong> The "Golden Ratio," considered crucial for long-term trends.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>100%:</strong> Full price retracement.</li>

                            <h2>How to Construct Fibonacci Levels?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Fibonacci levels are plotted on a chart by connecting two key extremes â€” the high and
                                low of a price
                                movement.
                                Once these points are selected, the software automatically calculates the retracement
                                levels.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Steps to Construct</h3>
                            <ol>
                                <li>Identify the extremes of the price movement: the high and the low.</li>
                                <li>Select the "Fibonacci" tool in your trading platform.</li>
                                <li>Drag lines from the high to the low for a downtrend or from the low to the high for
                                    an uptrend.</li>
                            </ol>

                            <h2>Practical Application of Fibonacci Levels</h2>
                            <h3>Identifying Support and Resistance Zones</h3>
                            <p>
                                One of the main applications of Fibonacci levels is identifying zones where the price is
                                likely to slow down
                                or reverse. For instance, the 61.8% level often serves as a support zone during a
                                downward price
                                retracement.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Trend Analysis</h3>
                            <p>
                                Upward and downward trends often include corrections where Fibonacci levels help traders
                                determine how deep
                                the price may pull back before continuing its movement.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Fibonacci Extensions</h3>
                            <p>
                                Fibonacci extension levels allow traders to forecast profit-taking points. For example,
                                the 161.8% and
                                261.8%
                                levels indicate potential targets after breaking previous highs or lows.
                            </p>

                                    analysis</a> tool, Fibonacci levels have their
                                limitations. They do not
                                perform well during
                                periods of strong news impact and require combination with other analysis methods, such
                                as candlestick
                                patterns
                                or volume indicators.

                            <p>
                                To use Fibonacci levels effectively, combine them with trend analysis, volume analysis,
                                and market context.
                                Regular practice and strategy testing will help traders achieve consistent results.

                                Fibonacci levels are a powerful tool for market analysis, enabling traders to forecast
                                reversal points and
                                price movements. Using them alongside other analysis tools makes trading more accurate
                                and effective. By
                                applying this method consciously, you can improve your results and strengthen your
