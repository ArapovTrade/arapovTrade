                    <h2 class="orange"> Intraday Trading Systems</h2>
                    <p>Trades usually last no more than one day. A prominent example of this approach is "scalping".</p>
                    <span class="orange">Pros:</span>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Short stops.</li>
                        <li>A large deposit is not necessary to start trading.</li>
                        <li>A greater potential for profit compared to other approaches.</li>
                        <li>More precise execution of individual movements.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="orange">Cons:</span>

                    <ul>
                        <li>More stressful work â€” the trader is mostly constantly near the trading terminal, making it
                            difficult to plan
                            their time.</li>
                        <li>Trades with good medium-term or long-term potential are closed at the end of the day in the
                            hope of re-entering
                            the same direction tomorrow.</li>
                        <li>A large number of trades can bring not only more profit but also increased risks.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="orange"> Medium-Term Trading Systems</h2>
                    <p>Trades last from several days to several weeks.</p>
                    <span class="orange">Pros:</span>


                    <ul>
                        <li>Work is conducted at a more relaxed pace.</li>
                        <li>The trader is less tied to the computer.</li>
                        <li>This approach allows the trader to pursue other activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="orange">Cons:</span>


                    <ul>
                        <li>Increased stop sizes.</li>
                        <li>Market reactions to important news can instantly nullify the trader's work over several
                            days.</li>
                        <li>Average earnings are generally lower than those of short-term traders.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h2 class="orange"> Long-Term Trading Systems</h2>
                    <p>Trades last from several weeks to several months. The trader essentially turns from a speculator
                        into an investor.
                    </p>
                    <span class="orange">Pros:</span>


                    <ul>
                        <li>The trader has enough time to analyze the market and make trading decisions.</li>
                        <li>The trader can fully dedicate themselves to other activities.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <span class="orange">Cons:</span>


                    <ul>
                        <li>A relatively large deposit is required.</li>
