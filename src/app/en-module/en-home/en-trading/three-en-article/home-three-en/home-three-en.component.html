                            <h2>Example of exchange operation</h2>
                            <p>
                                Consider an example of a stock exchange operation: a trader decides to purchase shares
                                of a company. Through
                                their broker, they place a buy order, which is sent to the exchange. If another party
                                agrees to sell the
                                shares at the specified price, the transaction is completed, and the exchange guarantees
                                its execution.
                            </p>

                                algorithmic trading, and blockchain technologies are transforming the market, making it
                                more accessible and
                                efficient.
