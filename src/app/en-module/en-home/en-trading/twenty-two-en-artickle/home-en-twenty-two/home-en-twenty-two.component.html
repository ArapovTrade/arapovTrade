                        <span style="background-color:#222;" class="orange">Economic Factors</span>
                    </h1>

                    <p>The importance of economic factors is explained by the fact that the exchange rate of any
                        currency directly depends
                        on the economic development of the country and the measures by which this rate is regulated.
                        Economic policy is
                        determined by the interests of industrial and financial groups, exporters and importers of goods
                        and capital, etc.
                        In addition, given the increasing interdependence of countries in the world, optimal economic
                        policy is a compromise
                        between national and foreign interests.</p>
                    <p>The main economic factors that significantly influence the dynamics of exchange rates are
                        economic indicators,
                        negotiations, meetings of central banks, economic and trade unions, speeches by the heads of
                        leading financial and
                        economic state institutions, specialists in economics and financial and credit operations,
                        agreements on joint
                        interventions.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Economic indicators are important in three aspects:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>expected level;</li>
                        <li>previous level;</li>
                        <li>range of forecasts.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>In addition, it is necessary to consider the behavior of other markets: the stock market, the
                        gold market, oil, and
                        agricultural products. If the central bank replenishes reserves by buying securities for resale,
                        the discount rate
                        will decrease, which, in turn, allows banks to reduce interest rates and causes the exchange
                        rate to fall.
                        Conversely, reducing the country's reserves by selling securities for repurchase in the future
                        leads to an increase
                        in the discount rate, higher loan costs, and increased interest in savings in the national
                        currency, which
                        strengthens it.</p>
                    <p>In case of rising oil prices for oil-importing countries, an increase in demand for the US dollar
                        can be expected,
                        which will lead to its appreciation. A decrease in gold prices increases the purchase of
                        securities, which leads to
                        their appreciation and, accordingly, strengthens the national currency. Similarly, the cheapness
                        of gold increases
                        interest in deposits, allowing banks to control the growth of interest rates and increase demand
                        for the national
                        currency.</p>
                    <p>To more accurately assess the impact of a particular indicator on the dynamics of exchange rates,
                        recent changes,
                        expert forecasts, and the relationship between various indicators should be considered. It is
                        expert forecasts that
                        often provoke market reactions, which either intensify when the data is announced (if the
                        forecast is confirmed) or,
                        on the contrary, change to the opposite (if the forecasts are wrong).</p>
