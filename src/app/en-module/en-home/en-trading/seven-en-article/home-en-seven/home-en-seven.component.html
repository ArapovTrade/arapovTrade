                                interest rates to
                                maintain economic stability.

                            <h2>Key FOREX Trading Sessions</h2>
                            <p>
                                The FOREX market operates across three major trading sessions, each with its unique
                                characteristics:
                            </p>
                            <h3>Asian Session</h3>
                            <p>
                                The Asian session begins with the opening of trading in Tokyo. At this time, currency
                                pairs such as
                                USD/JPY, AUD/USD, and NZD/USD are actively traded. This session is characterized by low
                                volatility and
                                stable prices.
                            </p>
                            <h3>European Session</h3>
                            <p>
                                Opens with the start of trading in Frankfurt and London. It is the most active session,
                                marked by high
                                liquidity and significant currency rate fluctuations.
                            </p>

                                Overlaps with the European session, leading to a sharp increase in volatility. Currency
                                pairs involving
                                the US dollar exhibit peak activity during this time.
                            </p>
                            <h2>Forex Trading Strategies</h2>
                            <p>
                                Successful trading on the FOREX market requires a strategic approach that considers
                                market specifics, asset types,
                                and individual trader goals. Each strategy has its own advantages and is suited to
                                particular market conditions.
                                Below, we explore popular and effective trading methods to help traders succeed in the
                                currency market.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Trend Trading</h3>
                            <p>
                                <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/trandingchannels">Trend trading</a>
                                is one of the most common approaches on the FOREX market. It is based on analyzing the
                                long-term price direction,
                                known as the trend. Traders use technical indicators such as moving averages, ADX, and
                                trend lines to determine the
                                market direction.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Principles:</strong> An uptrend is characterized by consecutive higher highs
                                    and higher lows, while a
                                    downtrend shows lower highs and lower lows.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Moving averages help smooth out price fluctuations and
                                    define the overall direction.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>Application:</strong> Traders open positions in the trend's direction, using
                                    signals from technical
                                    indicators for entry and exit.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                The main advantage of trend trading is the ability to capitalize on strong market
                                conditions. However, it’s
                                important to remember that trends are not permanent, and traders must be prepared for
                                reversals.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Scalping</h3>
                            <p>
                                <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/scalpingintrading">Scalping</a>
                                is a strategy focused on gaining small profits from rapid price movements. Scalpers
                                execute numerous trades over
                                short timeframes, holding positions from a few seconds to a few minutes.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Advantages:</strong> High trading frequency allows for profit even in
                                    low-volatility conditions.</li>
                                <li><strong>Risks:</strong> Scalping requires intense focus and quick reactions, as
                                    delays can lead to losses.</li>
                                <li><strong>Essential requirements:</strong> A reliable trading platform with minimal
                                    latency and low spreads is
                                    crucial for scalping.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                This strategy is suitable for traders who are willing to dedicate significant time to
                                market analysis and have
                                experience in fast-paced environments.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Level Trading</h3>
                            <p>
                                <a class="linkrefinto" href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/tradingoflevels">Level
                                    trading</a>
                                is based on analyzing key support and resistance zones where prices historically pause
                                or reverse. This allows
                                traders to leverage price behavior patterns for profit.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Support:</strong> A level where demand exceeds supply, halting a price
                                    decline.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resistance:</strong> A level where supply exceeds demand, preventing further
                                    price growth.</li>
                                <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Horizontal lines, price cluster zones, and technical
                                    indicators like RSI and MACD help
                                    identify these levels.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Level trading is ideal for traders who prefer to minimize risks and make decisions based
                                on historical data.
                            </p>

                                involves opening positions when the price breaks through key support or resistance
                                levels. These moves are often
                                accompanied by increased volumes, confirming the trend's strength.
