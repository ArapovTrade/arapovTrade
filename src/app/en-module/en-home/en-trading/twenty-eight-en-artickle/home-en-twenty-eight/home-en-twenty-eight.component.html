                    <p>Many traders have probably heard of the term "price action" or analysis using Japanese
                        candlesticks. However, the
                        graphical method of forecasting is very rich and offers an alternative to the types of analysis
                        mentioned above. It
                        involves concepts such as trend continuation and reversal patterns.</p>

                    <h3 class="orange">Trend Continuation Patterns</h3>
                    <p>Trend continuation patterns primarily include the flag and pennant. These models are fairly easy
                        to identify on a
                        FOREX chart. Their distinguishing feature is that they appear after quite strong impulses in one
                        direction.</p>

                    <p>For those unfamiliar with trend continuation patterns, such as the flag, they might seem like
                        traps. Many novice
                        traders often fall into these traps on FOREX, mistaking the flag for a trend reversal signal. In
                        reality, the flag
                        indicates a temporary market consolidation and preparation for a trend continuation.</p>
                    <div class="flex">

                    </div>
                    <h3 class="orange">Trend Reversal Patterns</h3>
                    <p>The choice of "price action" patterns in this category is much more diverse. These include
                        various wedges, head and
                        shoulders, double/triple bottoms/tops. All these models share that during their formation, the
                        trader already has an
                        idea of the further market movement. Trend reversal patterns on the FOREX market indicate
                        possible price corrections
                        in the near future.</p>
                    <div class="flex">

                    </div>
                    <p>What is important to remember when working with such patterns? Firstly, that they have their own
                        formation rules. If
                        the FOREX trader follows them carefully, success awaits. However, deviation from them can cause
                        significant failures
                        and losses. Moreover, professionals do not recommend trading within the patterns, preferring to
                        wait for clear
                        signals of their completion and the beginning of their development.</p>

                    <p>What are the advantages and disadvantages of using such patterns in work? The advantages include,
                        for example, that
                        they allow working in various market conditions on FOREX. This is effectively an alternative
                        that allows creating
                        your own trading strategies on FOREX, relying only on your strengths. Another advantage of
                        patterns is that they
                        appear on different time frames and can be used with any financial instruments. Regardless of
                        the asset the trader
                        uses, graphical analysis on FOREX allows finding profitable entry points.</p>

                    <p>On the other hand, this method of forecasting price fluctuations has significant disadvantages.
                        One of the main ones
                        is subjectivity in chart evaluation. The fact is that patterns almost never appear in their
                        classic form, leading to
                        disagreements. Two traders looking at the same chart can see completely different pictures.
                        Besides subjectivity,
                        there is also the factor of waiting. Not everyone will wait until the pattern is fully formed to
                        make a decision.
                        Many traders start working within the models, which can result in very negative consequences.
                        Until the pattern
                        gives a final signal, the trader simply cannot know if it will actually develop. There are known
                        cases when patterns
                        "broke" at the final stage of their formation.</p>
