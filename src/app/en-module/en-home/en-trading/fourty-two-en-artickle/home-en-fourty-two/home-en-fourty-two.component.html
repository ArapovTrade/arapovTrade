                    </h1>

                    <p><span class="orange">Timeframe</span> is the time interval of quotes displayed on the price
                        chart. When switching
                        from one timeframe to another, the "volume" of one candle or bar changes - the time that a
                        single bar represents.
                    </p>
                    <p>Simply put, a <span class="orange">timeframe</span> is the period of each candle or bar. For
                        example, if you have a
                        minute timeframe (M1), each candle on the chart will equal an interval of 1 minute. If the
                        timeframe is daily (D1),
                        each candle will equal 1 calendar day.</p>
                    <p>In fact, by changing the <span class="orange">timeframe</span>, a trader gains the ability to
                        analyze the dynamics of
                        a financial instrument in terms of grouping information over various intervals. The importance
                        of such analysis lies
                        in the need to forecast prices for different periods, depending on the specific trading
                        strategy.</p>

                    <p>The choice of trading period depends on several conditions, but the first and foremost is the
                        trading strategy of the
                        specific trader, of which there are several types:</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Scalping</h3>
                    <p>A strategy aimed at making a large number of quick trades, the period of closing which varies
                        from a few seconds to a
                        few minutes. The strategy involves using the shortest timeframes: one-minute (M1) and
                        five-minute (M5).</p>
