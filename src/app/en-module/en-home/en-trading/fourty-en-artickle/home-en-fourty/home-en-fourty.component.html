                        </span>
                    </h1>


                    <p>One of the main mistakes beginners make, often having no understanding of risk management, is
                        <span class="orange">refusing to limit
                            losses</span>. Many hold out hope for a price reversal until the last moment, which often
                        leads to
                        massive losses. The
                        price may eventually return to the trade's opening point, but will the trader have enough
                        capital to survive such
                        losses?
                    </p>
                    <p>This leads to <span class="orange">the primary rule</span> beginners should grasp: <span
                            class="orange">never trade without stop orders</span>. Often,
                        novice traders forego
                        risk management and even stop orders in favor of high-risk strategies, on which a few
                        professional traders once made
                        a big score.</p>
                    <p>However, it's crucial to understand that using such strategies even for experienced players is a
                        huge risk. For
                        beginners, these strategies are nearly suicidal since their implementation is almost impossible
                        without experience
                        and a steady hand. Relying on luck in stock trading is the quickest path to failure.</p>
