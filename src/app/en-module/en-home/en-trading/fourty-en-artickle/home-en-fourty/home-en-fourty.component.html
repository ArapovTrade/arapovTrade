                            <p>Trading on financial markets attracts more and more people due to its accessibility and
                                potential for
                                high profits. However, beginners often face serious challenges. The main reasons are a
                                lack of experience,
                                emotions, and the absence of a strategy. Let’s explore the most common mistakes beginner
                                traders make
                                and how to avoid them.</p>

                            <section>
                                <h2>Lack of Preparation</h2>
                                <h3>Lack of Market Knowledge</h3>
                                <p>Many beginners start trading without understanding how the market works, what
                                    liquidity, volatility,
                                    and market orders are. This superficial approach to market fundamentals often leads
                                    to avoidable
                                    mistakes. For instance, not knowing the difference between a market order and a
                                    limit order can result
                                    in unexpected losses.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, many underestimate the importance of understanding macroeconomic
                                    factors such as interest
                                    rates, inflation, and economic reports, which directly influence asset price
                                    movements.</p>
                                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Dedicate time to studying the basics of trading,
                                    including

                            <p><strong>Advice:</strong> Use educational materials such as online courses, books,
                                and articles to gain basic knowledge. Practice on a demo account to reinforce the theory
                                with practical experience.

                                <h2>Ignoring Risk Management</h2>
                                <h3>Betting on a Single Trade</h3>
                                <p>Many traders risk too much of their capital on a single trade, hoping for quick
                                    profits. This makes them vulnerable to any market fluctuations. For example,
                                    incorrect position sizing or
                                    using excessive leverage
                                    can lead to significant losses.</p>
                                <p>Another common mistake is the lack of diversification. Investing all funds in a
                                    single asset or currency pair
                                    creates significant risks, especially in volatile conditions.</p>
                                <p><strong>Solution:</strong> Follow the rule of "no more than 1–2% of the deposit per
                                    trade."
                                    It protects your capital even during a losing streak. Additionally, diversify your
                                    portfolio by including
                                    various assets
                                    with different levels of volatility and correlation.</p>
                                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Calculate position size before each trade.
                                    Use trading calculators to determine the optimal risk. Continuously analyze your
                                    results to understand which
                                    trades are the most effective.</p>

                                <h2>Overtrading</h2>
                                <h3>The Desire to Earn Quickly</h3>
                                <p>Many beginners aim to execute as many trades as possible, believing that quantity
                                    directly correlates with profits.
                                    However, overtrading often leads to fatigue, emotional burnout, and decreased focus.
                                    Instead of
                                    thoroughly analyzing the market, traders start relying on intuition, increasing the
                                    likelihood of mistakes.</p>
                                <p>Additionally, traders inclined to frequent trades often overlook rising costs,
                                    such as spreads and commissions, which can significantly reduce profits or even
                                    result in losses.</p>
                                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Focus on the quality of trades rather than their quantity.
                                    Set a maximum number of trades per day or week to avoid overloading yourself and
                                    minimize risks. Use a <a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/tradingplan">trading plan</a>
                                    to focus only on truly valuable opportunities.</p>
                                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Take regular breaks to restore focus and evaluate
                                    the market with
                                    a "clear head." This is especially important after a series of successful or
                                    unsuccessful trades,
                                    when there is a temptation to continue trading without proper analysis.</p>

                                <h2>Emotional Trading</h2>
                                <h3>Fear and Greed</h3>
                                <p>Emotions are a trader's biggest enemy. Fear of loss can lead to prematurely closing
                                    profitable trades, while
                                    greed can result in holding them for too long, turning profit into loss.
                                    Additionally, the desire to "recover"
                                    after a loss often results in impulsive and poorly thought-out decisions.</p>
                                <p>For example, a trader who has lost a significant portion of their deposit may open a
                                    new trade with high risk to
                                    quickly recover their money. Such behavior usually ends with even greater losses.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Work on emotional intelligence and discipline. Follow your
                                    pre-developed plan and avoid
                                    impulsive decisions. Use stop-loss and take-profit orders to minimize the influence
                                    of emotions on your trades.
                                </p>
                                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Practice relaxation techniques such as meditation or
                                    deep breathing to reduce
                                    stress. Keep a trading journal to record your emotions and actions, analyze your
                                    behavior, and improve
                                    self-control.</p>

                                <h2>Misuse of Leverage</h2>
                                <p><a class="linkrefinto"
                                        href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/forexleveragerisk">Leverage</a> is a
                                    powerful
                                    tool that allows traders to manage large amounts with a relatively small deposit.
                                    However, many beginners are
                                    drawn by the potential for quick profits and use excessive leverage. This can lead
                                    to significant losses even
                                    with minor market fluctuations.</p>
                                <p>For example, with a leverage of 1:100, a 1% price movement can result in a 100%
                                    profit or loss. Without proper
                                    risk management, a trader can lose their entire deposit in a single trade. High
                                    leverage also increases
                                    psychological pressure, as every market movement greatly impacts the capital.</p>
                                <p><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Beginners should use moderate leverage, such as 1:10
                                    or less. Calculate your
                                    position size considering your deposit and risk level. Ensure that even in the event
                                    of adverse market movement,
                                    your losses remain within an acceptable limit.</p>
                                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Test your strategies on a demo account before using leverage.
                                    This helps you understand how
                                    leverage affects trading results without risking real capital.</p>

                                <p>Mistakes are an inevitable part of any trader's journey, especially at the initial
                                    stages. However, it is
                                    important to understand that each mistake is an opportunity to learn and improve.

                                <p>Successful trading requires discipline, patience, and continuous learning. Monitor
                                    the market, manage risks, and
                                    focus on long-term goals. By avoiding common mistakes and applying proven management
                                    techniques, you can achieve
