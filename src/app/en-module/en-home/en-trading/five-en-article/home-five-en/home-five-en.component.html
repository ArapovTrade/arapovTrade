                                Derivatives, or financial instruments derived from other assets, play a critical role in
                                modern financial
                                markets. They are used for hedging risks, speculation, and increasing liquidity. In this
                                article, we will
                                explore what derivatives are, their main types, and how they are applied.
                            </p>

                            <h2>What Are Derivatives?</h2>
                            <p>
                                Derivatives are financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying asset.
                                They play an
                                essential
                                role in financial markets by providing participants with opportunities for risk
                                management, profit
                                generation,
                                and liquidity enhancement. The underlying assets for derivatives can include various
                                asset types: stocks,
                                bonds, currencies, commodities, indices, and even events such as weather conditions or
                                credit risks.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The application of derivatives is diverse and spans many aspects of trading and
                                financial management. From
                                large corporations to retail traders, everyone uses these instruments to achieve their
                                goals.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Hedging:</strong> Derivatives are actively used to protect against market
                                    risks. For instance,
                                    companies dependent on oil prices may use futures contracts to lock in the cost of
                                    raw materials,
                                    thereby
                                    reducing the impact of sudden price fluctuations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Speculation:</strong> Derivatives allow traders to profit from predicting
                                    price changes. For
                                    example, by purchasing a call option on a stock, a trader can profit from its
                                    increase without needing
                                    to
                                    buy the stock outright.</li>
                                <li><strong>Arbitrage:</strong> Investors use derivatives to profit from price
                                    differences between various
                                    markets. For instance, if the price of an underlying asset is lower on one market
                                    than on another,
                                    arbitrage trades can eliminate these discrepancies.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                With the advancement of technology and the globalization of financial markets,
                                derivatives have become even
                                more significant. They help participants not only manage risks but also allocate capital
                                efficiently.
                            </p>

                            <h3>Key Characteristics of Derivatives</h3>
                            <p>
                                To better understand how derivatives work, it's essential to consider their key
                                characteristics:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Dependency on underlying asset:</strong> The value of a derivative is always
                                    determined by
                                    changes
                                    in the price of the associated asset.</li>
                                <li><strong>Fixed terms:</strong> The terms of the agreement (execution date, price,
                                    volume) are clearly
                                    defined in the contract.</li>
                                <li><strong>Margin requirements:</strong> Many derivatives require margin deposits,
                                    reducing risks for both
                                    parties.</li>
                                <li><strong>Risks:</strong> While derivatives are useful for hedging, they also carry a
                                    high level of risk,
                                    especially for inexperienced traders.</li>
                            </ul>

                                Derivatives are divided into several types, each with unique characteristics and
                                applications,
                                such as risk hedging, speculation, and asset management. Letâ€™s take a closer look at the
                                main
