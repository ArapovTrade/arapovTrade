                    <p>Helping a trader effectively execute their activities involves maintaining a trading plan. A
                        trading plan should be a
                        mandatory element for every trader. Developing a trading plan disciplines the trader and helps
                        them not deviate from
                        their trading strategies in stressful situations.</p>
                    <p>A trading plan should outline the following aspects:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong class="orange">Profit and loss limits:</strong> The trader must control their
                            emotions and avoid
                            drawdowns beyond set limits. At the same time, it's essential to have a clear goal and the
                            ability to take
                            profits in a timely manner.</li>
                        <li><strong class="orange">Entry and exit conditions:</strong> It is necessary to determine in
                            advance under what
                            conditions the trader will apply certain entry and exit strategies.</li>
                        <li><strong class="orange">Key events of the trading day:</strong> Determining the release date
                            of important news
                            for the traded instruments to be ready for market reactions at the time of their
                            publication.</li>
                        <li><strong class="orange">Details:</strong> It is necessary to specify the instruments used,
                            open charts, and
                            applied timeframes. It is also worth noting the probable instruments with which deals may be
                            concluded based on
                            correlation.</li>
                        <li><strong class="orange">Trading conditions:</strong> Determining the conditions under which
                            the trader stops
                            trading, such as changes in volatility, unexpected price movements, or deterioration of the
                            psychological state.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>It is recommended to prepare reports on past trades at the end of the trading day to regularly
                        record the main
                        trading indicators. This will help assess the effectiveness of the chosen trading strategy in
                        the future.</p>
