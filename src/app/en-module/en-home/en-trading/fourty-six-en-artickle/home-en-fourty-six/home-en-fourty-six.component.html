                    <h1 class="orange">Main Reasons for Losing Money on the Stock Exchange</h1>
                    <h3 class="orange">Trading Against the Trend</h3>
                    <p>This is a common mistake among beginners. Lack of understanding of what creates trends in the
                        market can lead to
                        serious losses. It is important to have a theoretical foundation and a strategy to always be on
                        the side of the
                        winners.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Trading in One Time Frame</h3>
                    <p>Not understanding market mechanics can lead to mistakes. It is important to always consider the
                        "senior" time frame,
                        as large players often act on longer periods. Observing different time frames helps to better
                        understand the current
                        trend.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Tilt (Emotional Influence)</h3>
                    <p>Psychological aspects play a crucial role. Trying to quickly recoup losses can only worsen the
                        situation due to
                        unsystematic trading.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Premature Profit Taking</h3>
                    <p>Inability to understand the current market phase and main trend can lead to premature position
                        closures.
                        Professionals try to stay in the trend until the end, as they are aware of the real market
                        picture.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Inability to Adjust the Trading System</h3>
                    <p>It is important to be able to adapt your trading strategy to changing market conditions. The lack
                        of a clear trading
                        system can make it difficult to understand market behavior.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Averaging Down</h3>
                    <p>Averaging can be useful when used correctly in the direction of the main trend. However, without
                        understanding the
                        trend, a trader can accumulate too large a trading volume, leading to losses due to insufficient
                        margin coverage.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Making "Huge" Trades</h3>
                    <p>Attempting to make too large trades without sufficient margin coverage can lead to position
                        liquidations due to
                        margin calls. This is especially relevant during market corrections.</p>
                    <p>These main reasons for account losses in the market serve as lessons on the path to successful
                        trading. Learning from
                        others' experiences and developing your own strategy will help avoid common mistakes and start
                        earning right away.
                    </p>
