                    <h3 class="orange">Capital Management (Risk Management)</h3>
                    <p>Capital management plays a critical role in trading, as it allows effective risk control and
                        ensures the long-term
                        sustainability of a trading strategy. Here are the main aspects and differences between risk
                        management and money
                        management:</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">What is Risk Management in Trading?</h3>
                    <p>Risk management in trading is the control over transactions to minimize potential losses. It
                        includes strategies and
                        rules that define:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The size of each trading position (lots or contracts).</li>
                        <li>The maximum allowable level of risk for one trade or overall.</li>
                        <li>The overall level of risk across all open positions relative to your total capital.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Risk management helps the trader survive the inevitable unsuccessful trades and maintain the
                        opportunity for
                        subsequent profitable trades.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Differences between Risk Management and Money Management</h3>
                    <p>Money management is a broader concept that encompasses strategies for managing all of a trader's
                        capital, including
                        investments, diversification, asset selection, and risk hedging.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Money management focuses on maximizing the efficiency of overall capital management, while
                            risk management
                            specifically targets managing the risks associated with individual trades.</li>
                        <li>Contrary to popular belief, money management does not include aspects such as investment
                            diversification or
                            asset selection, which fall under the scope of risk management.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3 class="orange">Why is Risk Management Important?</h3>
                    <p>Implementing risk management strategies significantly increases a trader's chances of long-term
                        success. This allows:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Effective risk management and capital preservation in volatile market conditions.</li>
                        <li>Planning and controlling the level of potential losses for each trade.</li>
                        <li>Distributing capital across different trading strategies and instruments, reducing overall
                            financial risk.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Without risk management, beginners often face high risks of losing their entire deposit due to
                        ill-considered trades
                        or improperly distributed risks.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Risk Management Recommendations</h3>
                    <p>The most commonly recommended rule in trading is to not risk more than 2-5% of your deposit on a
                        single trade. This
                        helps minimize losses in case of unsuccessful trades and preserve capital for subsequent market
                        opportunities.</p>
                    <p>Effective risk management is a key element of a successful trading strategy, ensuring stability
                        and sustainability in
                        the long run.</p>
