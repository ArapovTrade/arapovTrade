                                <p><strong>From the Author:</strong> Dear reader, on this website, you will find a list
                                    of trading topics for <strong>self-study</strong>. Trading theory is vast, and if
                                    you are already familiar with this profession, you understand how much information
                                    needs to be mastered
                                    before starting to trade.
                                </p>

                                <p>With over <strong>12 years</strong> of trading experience, I can confidently say that
                                    <strong>not all information is important</strong> for learning and often leads
                                    only to a waste of valuable time. That‚Äôs why I have prepared materials for
                                    <strong>beginner traders</strong> who are interested in this profession so they can
                                    fully
                                    familiarize themselves with the market. At the same time, I have tried to provide
                                    only
                                    truly important information for a general understanding of theory and have
                                    deliberately excluded
                                    several topics that, in my opinion, are not critically significant for becoming a
                                    trader.
                                </p>

                                <h2>üìä The Connection Between Technical and Fundamental Analysis in Trading</h2>

                                <p>Undoubtedly, a trader‚Äôs task is to be able to connect <strong>technical market
                                        factors</strong>,
                                    such as support and resistance levels,
                                    chart patterns, trading volumes,
                                    signals from various indicators, etc., with <strong>fundamental factors</strong>,
                                    which are related to economic
                                    indicators such as interest rates,
                                    company earnings reports,
                                    inflation,
                                    industrial production indicators, and so on.
                                </p>

                                <h3>The Importance of Technical Analysis</h3>

                                <p>Based on the above, I emphasize the <strong>introduction of beginner traders</strong>
                                    to technical market analysis, which I have actively used throughout my trading
                                    career.</p>

                                <p>In my opinion, <strong>technical analysis</strong> is the most
                                    objective tool for making decisions about where the market might move. It allows
                                    traders to:</p>

                                <section>
                                    <p>This list allows you to build a <strong>‚Äúroadmap‚Äù</strong> for mastering
                                        the trading profession and provides
                                        sufficient understanding of the direction to develop. I also believe that
                                        studying these topics gives
                                        a complete understanding of all risks associated with trading and allows
                                        anyone interested to make
                                        an informed decision about pursuing this profession.</p>

                                    <p>Trading is closely linked to the <strong>‚Äúsearch for truth‚Äù</strong>, just like
                                        in chess ‚Äì
                                        the smartest wins. This
                                        profession touches various aspects of a person‚Äôs life and leads to deep
                                        changes that contribute
                                        to the development of qualities such as <strong>discipline</strong>,
                                        <strong>patience</strong>, and <strong>critical
                                            thinking</strong>. The trader‚Äôs journey is often not easy and at times
                                        extremely challenging, but in the end,
                                        one gains the ability to analyze and actively manage capital, which is
                                        highly valuable in today‚Äôs world.
