                        <h1>Free Trading Training. Introduction</h1>

                        <h2>From the Author</h2>
                        <p>Dear reader, on this website, you will find a list of <strong>trading</strong> topics for
                            self-study.
                            The theory of trading is very extensive, and I believe that if you are already familiar with
                            this profession,
                            you understand how much information needs to be mastered before starting trading.</p>

                        <p>Having more than 12 years of experience in trading, I can confidently say that not all
                            information
                            is essential for learning, and often it simply leads to a waste of valuable time.
                            Therefore, I have prepared materials for beginner traders who are interested in this
                            profession,
                            aiming to provide only the most important information for a general understanding of the
                            theory.
                            I have deliberately excluded several trading topics that I do not consider essential for a
                            trader’s development.
                        </p>

                        <h2>What is Important for a Trader?</h2>
                        <p>Undoubtedly, a trader's task is to <strong>connect
                                <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/technicalanalysis">technical</a>
                                and <a class="linkrefinto"
                                    href="https://arapov.trade/en/freestudying/fundamentalanalysis">fundamental</a>
                                market factors</strong>, such as:</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Technical factors:</strong> levels, chart patterns, trading volume analysis,
                                indicators, etc.</li>
                            <li><strong>Fundamental factors:</strong> interest rates, company earnings reports,
                                inflation, industrial production indicators, etc.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>From the above, I emphasize introducing beginner traders to <strong>technical market
                                analysis</strong>,
                            which I have actively used throughout my trading career.
                            In my opinion, technical analysis is the most objective method for making decisions about
                            where the market may
                            go,
                            analyzing “supply and demand” of the traded instrument, and identifying potentially
                            profitable levels and
                            prices for entering a position.</p>

                        </p>

                        <p><strong>Trading</strong> is inseparable from the "search for truth."
                            Just as in chess, the smartest player wins.
                            This profession touches various aspects of a person's life and leads to deep transformations
                            that foster qualities such as discipline, patience, and critical thinking.
                            The trader's path is often challenging and sometimes extremely difficult,
                            but in the end, the individual acquires the ability to analyze and actively manage capital,
                            which is highly valuable in today’s world.</p>
