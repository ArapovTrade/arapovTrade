                    <h1 class="orange">Types of Timeframes</h1>
                    <h3 class="orange">Short-Term Timeframes</h3>
                    <p>When choosing which timeframe is best for intraday trading, it is essential to first look at
                        short-term timeframes.
                        The most common short-term trading periods are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="orange">M1 (One Minute)</span></li>
                        <li><span class="orange">M5 (Five Minutes)</span></li>
                        <li><span class="orange">M15 (Fifteen Minutes)</span></li>
                        <li><span class="orange">M30 (Thirty Minutes)</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There is also a rarely used "tick" chart, which shows every price change in any direction.
                        However, trading on such a
                        chart, let alone making any forecasts based on it, is extremely difficult due to the high
                        randomness of the data.
                        There are strategies based on tick charts, but their successful implementation requires
                        significant experience.</p>
                    <p>The most effective timeframes <span class="orange">M1</span> and <span class="orange">M5</span>
                        are used in scalping,
                        as the strategy involves analyzing the chart to obtain almost instantaneous profit from small
                        price fluctuations,
                        with trade durations of no more than a few minutes.</p>
                    <p>In the intraday strategy, the <span class="orange">M1</span> period is rarely used due to its low
                        predictability,
                        which does not meet the requirements of trading with trade durations of up to several hours. The
                        <span class="orange">H1</span> timeframe is used in intraday trading primarily for reference
                        purposes. The main
                        trading periods for intraday traders are <span class="orange">M5</span>, <span
                            class="orange">M15</span>, and <span class="orange">M30</span>.
                    </p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Medium-Term Timeframes</h3>
                    <p>In medium-term trading strategies, the most commonly used timeframes are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="orange">H1 (One Hour)</span></li>
                        <li><span class="orange">H4 (Four Hours)</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>When predicting price dynamics for up to a few days, the most informative trading periods are
                        considered to be <span class="orange">H1</span> and <span class="orange">H4</span>. Charts with
                        these timeframes allow for technical
                        analysis and the identification of trading signals on this interval, without being too detailed,
                        allowing for the
                        ignoring of signals from small intraday fluctuations.</p>
                    <h3 class="orange">Long-Term Timeframes</h3>
                    <p>Long-term traders, or investors, typically use the following trading periods for analysis:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><span class="orange">Daily</span></li>
                        <li><span class="orange">Weekly</span></li>
                        <li><span class="orange">Monthly</span></li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>There are also timeframes with intervals of several months and yearly, but they are mainly used
                        for reference
                        purposes, not for direct trading.</p>
                    <p>It is important not to get fixated on one or two timeframes, so as not to miss important aspects
                        of the market's
                        condition. Beginners are advised to start trading with longer-term timeframes and gradually move
                        to shorter ones as
                        they gain experience.</p>
                    <p>When choosing a primary timeframe, it is important to focus primarily on the chosen trading
                        strategy. A too short
                        timeframe will not be useful for long-term trading. It is crucial to clearly understand your
                        trading strategy before
                        opening trades to avoid losses.</p>
