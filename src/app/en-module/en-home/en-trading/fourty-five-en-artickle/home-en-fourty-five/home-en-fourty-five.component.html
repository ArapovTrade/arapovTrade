                <h2>From the Author</h2>
                <p>
                  <strong></strong> Dear reader, on this website, you will find
                  a free trading course designed for self-study. Having been actively
                  engaged in trading since 2013, I can confidently say: not all
                  information is equally useful. Many topics only distract
                  attention and slow down the learning process. Therefore, I set
                  out to create the most concise theoretical material that is,
                  at the same time, practical in application. This course can be
                  studied in a flexible format, depending on the learner‚Äôs
                  experience.

                <h2>Main Learning Topics</h2>
                <p>
                  The course covers key trading sections necessary for a
                  confident start. All sections are structured to simplify the
                  learning process, focus on the essentials, and effectively
                  prepare for practical trading. Each section consists of a set
                  of articles with a consistent structure, progressing from one
                  section to the next. At the end of each section, you can learn
                  about its benefits and the main topics covered.

                    >The value of the ‚ÄúTechnical Market Analysis‚Äù section lies
                    in providing practical tools and methods for predicting
                    price movements in the market. The section helps understand
                    how to ‚Äúread‚Äù a chart by analyzing price and market behavior
                    without relying on fundamental analysis. You will study the
                    core elements of technical analysis, such as support and
                    resistance levels, trends, channels, patterns, and
                    candlestick patterns, enabling you to accurately identify
                    entry and exit points for trades. Topics like Elliott Wave
                    analysis, Fibonacci levels, and patterns (flag, triangle,
                    head and shoulders, 1-2-3, double top, and bottom) will
                    teach you to recognize recurring market structures, allowing
                    you to make predictions about future market movements. You
                    will also learn how to use indicators and moving averages
                    for additional signal confirmation and filtering out ‚Äúnoise‚Äù
                    on the chart. As a result of completing this block, a
                    beginner trader transforms from someone who guesses into a
                    more systematic and confident market participant, using
                    objective data to make decisions about entering and exiting
                    positions.</i

                    The benefit of this section, which includes topics on market
                    phases, volumes, and exchange mechanisms, lies in providing
                    a deep understanding of the market‚Äôs internal structure and
                    the logic behind price movements. This is the next level
                    after basic technical analysis ‚Äî a more professional and
                    precise approach.

                    Here are its main advantages: understanding market phases
                    and trend anatomy allows you to determine where the market
                    currently stands‚Äîaccumulation, growth, distribution, or
                    decline‚Äîand act accordingly. A deep understanding of pricing
                    and liquidity explains where prices come from, how orders
                    work, and why prices move‚Äîyou begin to see the ‚Äúmechanics‚Äù
                    of the market. The skill of working with the order book and
                    tape of prints provides insight into the intentions of large
                    players and allows you to identify potential reversals or
                    impulses before they appear on the chart. Volume analysis:
                    Wyckoff, Steidlmayer, and accumulation levels‚Äîyou‚Äôll learn
                    how volume reveals the true behavior of supply and demand,
                    distinguishing ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù from the crowd and predicting
                    likely price developments. The market auction and sentiment
                    analysis enable you to assess the psychology of participants
                    and understand who controls the market at any given
                    moment‚Äîbuyers or sellers. Setting stop-losses based on
                    market structure helps you place protections logically,
                    reducing the likelihood of being stopped out. Price
                    forecasting based on volume and participant behavior
                    provides a strategic advantage: you don‚Äôt just follow the
                    price, you understand why it moves. Ultimately, this section
                    teaches you to think like a professional trader, relying not
                    only on charts but also on logic, volumes, structure, and
                    market participant behavior.

                    The section dedicated to Smart Money Concepts provides both
                    beginner and advanced traders with a deep understanding of
                    the behavior of large market players and teaches how to
                    analyze the market from the perspective of liquidity,
                    manipulations, and the intentions of market makers and other
                    major participants. This is a practical foundation that
                    allows you to stop being part of the ‚Äúcrowd‚Äù and start
                    thinking like a professional. You‚Äôll learn how banks, funds,
                    and market makers think and trade, that they don‚Äôt ‚Äúguess‚Äù
                    but create price movements by taking liquidity from the
                    market. This enables you to trade alongside them, not
                    against them. Topics like imbalance, order blocks, FVG, and
                    liquidity zones teach you to identify key areas on the chart
                    where hidden actions of large players occur. You‚Äôll learn to
                    recognize techniques such as false breakouts, stop hunting,
                    and hidden orders (iceberg) and avoid the common traps that
                    90% of traders fall into. You‚Äôll start to understand where
                    the crowd‚Äôs stop-losses accumulate and how large players use
                    them to open their positions. This helps you build trades
                    based on the real interests of big money in the market. The
                    section includes clear entry strategies and a step-by-step
                    guide: from identifying market structure to placing trades
                    with minimal risk and high profit potential.

                    Ultimately, this section provides an understanding of market
                    architecture, teaches you to think like a market maker, see
                    market manipulations, and use them to your advantage. It‚Äôs
                    the key to transitioning from chaotic trading to systematic,
                    professional trading. Detailed trade examples with full
                    descriptions and step-by-step guidance provide an excellent
                    practical foundation for finding profitable entry points on
                    the chart with an optimal ‚Äúprofit/loss‚Äù ratio.

                    >The benefit of the section dedicated to the psychology of
                    trading and the reasons for losses lies in the fact that it
                    helps to recognize and control internal factors that prevent
                    a trader from achieving consistent results. This is one of
                    the key components of successful trading, which is often
                    underestimated. The section helps to understand why most
                    traders lose their deposits ‚Äî usually not because of a
                    ‚Äúwrong strategy,‚Äù but due to fear, greed, lack of
                    discipline, and unrealistic expectations. The market creates
                    numerous mental ‚Äútraps‚Äù: from the desire to recover losses
                    to euphoria after profits. By recognizing them, a trader
                    learns not to give in to emotions and avoid rash decisions.

                    >You will learn how emotions affect thinking, risk
                    perception, and decision-making, which allows you to remain
                    calm even under high stress. The topic of ‚Äúgambling vs.
                    business‚Äù helps to shift your mindset: not to play, but to
                    act like an entrepreneur ‚Äî with calculation, risks, and a
                    clear plan. Familiarity with the biography and methods of
                    William Gann motivates and shows how psychological
                    discipline combines with technical analysis to achieve
                    success. You don‚Äôt just learn to press buttons on a
                    platform; you build a mindset that helps you withstand
                    series of losses, stick to your plan, and treat trading as
                    systematic work. This section is the foundation for stopping
                    being an emotional player and starting to work as a stable
                    trader. Without psychological preparation, no strategy will
                    yield results in the long term.</i

                    analysis lies in the fact that it helps a trader understand
                    why the market moves in a particular direction based on
                    global economic and political factors. This provides a
                    broader picture of events and allows for informed trading
                    decisions, especially in the medium and long term. You will
                    learn to assess the impact of macroeconomics on asset
                    prices, understand global trends, and recognize the
                    fundamental reasons for the movement of currencies, stocks,
                    and indices. Inflation, interest rates, employment, GDP ‚Äî
                    all these affect market participants‚Äô behavior. The section
                    explains how to interpret and use these indicators in
                    trading. You will also learn how global stock indices
                    reflect economic sentiment and how news and press releases
                    can trigger significant market movements.

                    trader and provides sufficient understanding of the
                    direction in which to develop. I also believe that studying
                    these topics provides a comprehensive understanding of all
                    the risks associated with trading and allows anyone
                    interested to make an informed decision about the necessity
                    of pursuing this profession.

                  <p>
                    Trading is inextricably linked with the
                    <strong>‚Äúsearch for truth‚Äù</strong>, just like in chess ‚Äî
                    the smartest wins. This profession touches on various
                    aspects of a person‚Äôs life and leads to profound changes
                    that foster the development of qualities such as
                    <strong>discipline</strong>, <strong>patience</strong>, and
                    <strong>critical thinking</strong>. The path of a trader is
                    often challenging and sometimes extremely difficult, but
                    ultimately, a person gains the ability to analyze and
                    actively manage capital, which is extremely valuable in the
                    modern world.
