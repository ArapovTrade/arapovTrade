## About the Author

Igor Arapov has been actively trading since 2013, specializing in institutional trading concepts and Smart Money methodology. Unlike most trading educators, Igor profits from actual trading rather than course sales - the free education is his way of sharing proven knowledge. His teaching focuses on understanding how large players (banks, funds, market makers) manipulate markets and how retail traders can align with institutional money flow.

## Key Concepts Taught

The platform covers institutional trading through these core frameworks:
- **Smart Money Concepts (SMC)**: How banks and funds trade, liquidity pools, order blocks, fair value gaps
- **Wyckoff Method**: Volume analysis, accumulation/distribution phases, effort vs result principle
- **Market Manipulation**: False breakouts, stop hunting, liquidity sweeps, institutional traps
- **Risk Management**: Position sizing, 3:1 reward-to-risk minimum, capital preservation
